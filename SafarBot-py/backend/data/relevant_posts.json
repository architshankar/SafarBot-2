    "selftext": "Update: Thanks to everyone for their kind words and different perspectives! In the end, I flew back to Bolivia to spend my last week in South America with him\u2026 and it went so well he applied for an Australian working-holiday visa and is moving next month! ;)\n\nOriginal post: I\u2019m (30F) currently on a four month solo trip around South America. While in Bolivia I met a European man (30M) and spontaneously decided to follow him into the Andes to go hiking. We got on amazingly well but didn\u2019t cross any physical lines (both too shy), and then I headed to Brazil for a few weeks.\n\nWhile in Brazil we kept in contact and three weeks later I flew back to Bolivia on a return flight. He had hung around La Paz and we arranged to meet up the night I arrived. I slept at his but we didn\u2019t have sex until the morning, taking things slowly as it had been a while for us both and we knew it would make parting harder. \n\nWe then spent three really special days/nights together before parting ways (we\u2019re travelling in opposite directions). We shared everything of ourselves, and I\u2019ve never felt so calm and safe and adored by a man. When we parted I cried and told him I really hoped to be loved by someone just like him one day.\n\nIt\u2019s been a couple of days now and we\u2019re still in contact, and while I\u2019m still having fun in Peru and enjoying my travels I\u2019m also struggling. I have half a mind to loop back to Bolivia to meet him for the last few days of my trip, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth the heartache of another goodbye. \n\nAt the same time I feel I\u2019d regret not taking the opportunity to be with him while we\u2019re on the same continent (I\u2019m Australian), even if only for a couple of nights. I really haven\u2019t felt a connection to someone this strong in a long time, and I know without any doubt that the feeling is mutual. \n\nDoes anyone have any similar stories or thoughts on what I should do? To pursue it or let it pass as a beautiful, fleeting moment? I\u2019ve had travel romances before but never one this intense. I can\u2019t stop thinking about him and it\u2019s driving me a nuts! ",

      "I say go for it. I had a long term romance that ended with his passing away. I would have done things differently and move to be with him if I had a chance to do it all over again.",
      "Not saying don't do it but it's easy to get swept up in a travel romance for the obvious reasons.\nI would think about the long term logistics, if it works out who is going to move where, what work/career will that lead to, what visas you will need etc.\n\nI know it's not fun to think about that part now but when the honey moon phase ends that is what you are going to have to deal with and it can be extremely difficult.\n\n I would try to think a little logically without getting swept up in the emotion. And as strong as you feel now you only know this person for a short time on travel mode. \n\nAgain I'm not saying not to do it, it might work out. Maybe you should go and see him again without too many expectations and see how it goes the second time",
      "I met an American guy on my trip and we only had a night of flirting then drunk kissing but it gave me a huge confidence boost I really needed. I am gutted I didn't see him longer but the holiday romance is real. Go get your man, girl!",
      "Although I had a couple of fun romances when I travelled none that ever ended up being a long-term connection. That being said, what do you have to lose in giving it a shot. The worst thing that happens is it doesn\u2019t work out and you move on and you have a great story for down the road.",
      "Do it - even if it's just for the memory. I had a whirlwind travel romance like that once. It didn't continue after the travel but it was perfect in it's brevity and intensity. I still feel a rush when I think about it :)",
      "If you don't get on that plane right now!! I married my travel romance. The feelings you're describing are just like mine. It's better to have loved and lost. Just go for it.",
      "I ended up in a relationship from a travel romance. It didn't last, partly because the day to day life was very different from the spontaneous travel context we got to know each other in. I don't regret going for it, despite the heartbreak."

    "selftext": "It was my first time traveling solo and I decided to do it in Thailand. At first I wasn\u2019t feeling it. I decided two weeks travel is enough for my first solo. I had no expectations, didn\u2019t even had an itinerary which I wish I stayed longer. I\u2019m a Filipino btw, so it\u2019s not in our culture to travel solo since most filipinos wants to travel with their friends or family and I got out from a toxic relationship and wanted to be free. Its a liberating move for me during that time.  Even my mom thought I was crazy LOL \n\nI decided to booked my first solo in a party hostel at Khaosan Road but I didn\u2019t like it so I moved to a different one. I stayed at Once Again Hostel. \nI thought everyone were traveling with friends so I decided to download dating apps just to meet people \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I\u2019m desperate to have a company during that time. Since most of the people in my hostels were europeans, I felt outcast. I\u2019m like the only asian in the hostel except the staff working there. \n\nI had a tinder date the first night I stayed in the hostel that I moved in and he left me in China town after, due to the intense heat according to him \ud83e\udd23\n\nGoing back to the story, I went back to the hostel feeling a bit sad and alone, thats when I decided to stay outside the hostel lobby a bit longer. There are benches and tables there. I didn\u2019t know it was a hangout spot for solo travelers, I was sitting with the other people from the hostel and ended up talking and getting to know them. Finally, enjoying their company, I saw this Italian guy who went out of the hostel all smiling. Even his eyes are smiling. Gad I still remember it so vividly. Seems like yesterday. \n\nHe was wearing a blue shirt and he\u2019s so cute and freaking hot. He\u2019s tall and i\u2019m a petite woman. He has nice muscles that fits PERFECTLY into his shirt. hehe \ud83d\ude1c He has beautiful sleepy eyes, nice curly hair, has piercings  which add up to his bad boy aura as he was always holding and smoking his vape. LOL HE LOOKS LIKE A MIXED OF A YOUNGER VERSION OF  ADRIEN SEMBLAT AND NICO BOLZICO. IF YOU ARE FROM THE PHILIPPINES YOU\u2019LL KNOW AHAHAH. He stood out from all the typical blonde and blue eyes guys who were staying in the hostel. I find out he was 31 years old which is a plus for me coz most people I met look older but ended up being way too young for me. I\u2019m 27 during that time btw. \n\nDuring that night we went out and partied with the other people in the hostel. We had a short and simple conversation and I grab the chance to ask for his socials but ended up getting his whatsapp instead when the other girls from my hostel were asking for it lol \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 There were actually 2 girls who were also  interested with him \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23 Turns out he wasn\u2019t into socials, his facebook photo was from years ago. \n\nIn short, I was the one who made the first move. I didn\u2019t take it seriously coz I was just kilig (excited) to meet him. The first night was nothing special we had our hi\u2019s and hellos just a little chitchat and he even mentioned he has a filipino friend and that I speak good english. HAHA he told me he\u2019s going to the italian embassy the next day to get his passport fixed that\u2019s why he\u2019s heading back to the hostel early and ofcourse I went back with him and the other two girls (thanks to lthem because I had the courage to ask for his number when they got his whatsapp \ud83e\udd23)\ud83e\udd23 We seated next to each other in the taxi and all of us girls were asking him questions getting to know him. \n\nDuring the second night stay in the hostel, we partied again with the other people and that\u2019s when I made my move and approached him again! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2d We dance and he hold my hand for the first time (def dying of kilig inside) during that night. We were both closer to each other while talking,  whispering ear to ear because we can\u2019t hear each other due to the sound from the bar. \n\nI told him I don\u2019t have any plans for the next few days, asked if I can join his travels. He mentioned that he\u2019ll be flying the next day to a different island and I said  I cant fly with him coz I only have 5 days left in Thailand. \n\nWe went back to the hostel earlier than the other people lol. We even grab some ice cream at 711.  We talked alot during that night, mind you he wasn\u2019t that good in english but we felt the instant connection. He just started learning english during his solo travels so he sort of have this strong italian accent which I\u2019m fond of. During that night he started getting touchy lol typical italian. We even made out in the rooftop  and I ended up sleeping in his hostel room lol (nothing happened between us during that night tho)\n\nThe next day we had our breakfast and he was so sweet. I never thought italians were fond of public display of affection and I wasn\u2019t used to it coz Philippines is quite a conservative country. He kisses me randomly while we were walking on the streets \ud83e\udd23\n\nHe decided to extend his stay in Bangkok for me. We explored the city together and felt this instant connection. We moved to a different city and stayed in a hotel after that. Did every normal couple would do, laugh, kiss, hold hands and even showered together every freaking time (too much info I know) \nHe ended up paying for everything. Our travels, food and he even took me to romantic places lol. Not that I\u2019m after his money tho :) He was really caring\u2026 The way he speak, his strong italian accent everytime he says \u201cI\u2019m worried\u201d and \u201cYOU ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL\u201d Got me. HAHAHA\n\nI  felt like I was in a romcom movie the whole time! He was the sweetest and the most romantic man I ever met. LITERALLY. IT FELT LIKE WE WERE A COUPLE. I WAS SCREAMING INSIDE. \nHE WAS GENUINE. HIS EYES, his actions. Everything. I knew there and then that I fell. HARD AND FAST. I REALIZE ITS SO EASY TO FALL INLOVE WHILE TRAVELING AND I NEED TO GUARD MY HEART. \n\nMy last night in Bangkok was a bit sad, we both felt it. We sang \u201cEvery breath you take\u201d while hugging and just enjoying the few hours left. Said our goodbyes and hugged each other. \n\nAfter the trip, I went back home a bit sad. Lol I even cried during my flight back home. I knew I got attached. He was caring and very affectionate. \n\nWe continued talking. He mentioned long distance will be hard and he had a fair share of bad experiences from the past so its a No for him. \nHe said both of us will get hurt in the end and that he is saving me from all the heartaches. lol . \n\nI HAD TO LET GO OF THE thought of us being together but we always find our way getting back together. I guess its the invisible string theory?? Coz before I met him I was wearing a shirt that has an Italy sign on it and I dreamt of experiencing an Italian summer. I even listed everything I want in a man. I feel like I manifested everything. After 2 months, the same day I wore the ITALY shirt, I met Mathew (the italian guy from the hostel) LOL and he has all the specific qualities I listed of what I wanted in a man. The height, the age, romantic, the emotional intelligence, etc. I even went too specific with what I want in a man to the point that I include that he is not into social media. EVERYTHING. It was so specific to the point it was kinda scary but so good at the same time??\n\nWhat Matthew and I had was special. I even thought I was just being delusional and was the only one feeling this way turns out he was feeling it too. He decided to visit me in the Philippines and as his last destination after back packing Southeast Asia for 5 months, before he went back to Italy. He spent his first Christmas away from his fam and spend it with mine. \n\nWe spent an entire month in the islands together. He even asked me to travel the world with him and go to Italy with him. My crazy inlove self said YES OFCOURSE LOL. \n\nA year after we first met, we got engaged and got married the following year after that. Funny how everything went by so fast. I guess, when you know, you know. \n\nWe already have two curly kids now. The other one looks exactly like him and the other one looks like me. \n\nI STILL FEEL GIDDY EVERYTIME I REMEMBER IT. HE\u2019S STILL THAT HOT ITALIAN GUY I HAD A CRUSH ON FROM THE HOSTEL. THE TRAVEL ROMANCE FELT STRAIGHT OUT OF A WATTPD INSPIRED MOVIE LOL\n\nAnd to the people asking, YES this is a real story. I\u2019m just too EXCITED TO SHARE THIS AHAHA and it\u2019s not always rainbows and butterflies. There was a time I had to do another solo trip to Taiwan just to get over him because he keeps on insisting that he is not into long distance relationships because he\u2019s from Italy and I\u2019m from the Philippines. Some people I made friends from the hostel find it funny when I tell this story that I fell inlove with the Italian guy I met after knowing him for less than a week of being together HAHAHA.\n\nBut look at us now, somehow it worked so well\u2026. Glad we both took the risk with the travel romance or travel fling ahaha whatever you called it :)",

      "One of the most difficult parts of solo travel \ud83e\udd79 the short romances and connections. Especially when you really click with them and get along. It brings a strong sense of excitement and comfort. And then when they leave, those high levels of dopamine drop right off. The contrast of experiences within a few days can sometimes emotionally drain you.\n\nTry to reframe your mindset. Be grateful for the lovely memories made with the person you had met. If you\u2019re still in contact, then maybe your journeys will cross again. \n\nBut ensure that you do open up to the idea that there are also many other beautiful connections that can be made on the rest of your travels. Whether it be romantic, or new friends, etc. \n\nAnd most importantly, embrace the time alone from a place of grace. It can feel very lonely, but it\u2019s peaceful and powerful. It\u2019s a time to reflect on the time you just had, reflect on what you may want in a partner in the future, what you would still like to accomplish on the rest of your trip, and mostly importantly, to rest <3",

Our personalities, humor, everything felt perfect. We wondered around the city, talking until 6AM. He was so sweet and caring and the relationship naturally turned physical. We spent the next day together then I was off to another city for a couple days. We stayed in contact the entire time, reminiscing, chatting, and being excited for the next time we were able to see each other.\n\nWe spend another beautiful night together and he introduced me to one of his close friends.

My heart immediately sank when I noticed. He\u2019s dressing up to leave and makes no mention of the plans we agreed to last night. Then he abruptly says this may be the last time I see him. It\u2019s my last weekend and he knew that. He made it seem like we would spend it together. I immediately begin crying and he slightly consoles me before leaving. He didn\u2019t seem sad in the slightest bit saying goodbye to me and that crushed me. \n\nHe was just telling me how special I was, talking about potentially visiting my state, wanting to know all about me. He even made a comment to our Uber driver jokingly saying I was his wife. He extended himself saying I am not alone here because I have him. \n\nLooking back, it might\u2019ve all been sweet nothings. I don\u2019t know what I expected. I don\u2019t think a relationship would\u2019ve been realistic but a part of me was hoping just maybe.

It was foolish of me to think it could be more even because we live in different countries but I appreciate the time I spent with her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry because it\u2019s over. Smile because it happened.\u201d",
      "The first travel feeling than heartbroken and stupid romance.",
      "So you had a nice time together, and then the fling came to an end as you were about to leave? Sounds like just a normal holiday romance to be honest.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like he treated you particularly badly (or vice versa). He didn\u2019t promise you a long term relationship, and it\u2019s not reasonable to expect one in those circumstances.\n\nJust enjoy it for the fun time that it was. And if you found it too heartbreaking, probably best just avoid holiday romances in the future.",
      "How can you expect a relationship when you both live completely different lives?\n\nAlso as mentioned, holiday romances hardly works out in the long run anyway, simply because of this.",
      "I believe the connections of travel romances are real, especially how quickly and easily you vibed. Trust that you know that. Do not question yourself when it comes to connection \ud83d\udc96. \nBut I also believe that travel romances can be such a whirlwind, and so intense, because you both think it won\u2019t be more than a moment in time, as if nothing matters, you can bare it all - be fully open and vulnerable - and you accept one another fully for all they are and are not, knowing they won\u2019t have to plug into your life (and vice versa). It\u2019s what makes them soo soo beautiful. It\u2019s why \u2018regular\u2019 relationships don\u2019t usually feel as strong. \nIt\u2019s not uncommon to get your heart tied up in a first travel romance\u2026 the whole thing was a decision from your heart! Take the good memories, or things you learned about yourself, from this experience, and keep on living as fully as you are \ud83d\udc96.",
      "Exact thing just happened to me. I've traveled solo for years and have had a few romantic connections along the way. But these men never made any promises, and I remember those experiences with fond memories. But this recent one was the boss of all players. Never have I felt so stupid and naive in my life. I was love bombed, sold a fantasy, gaslit to believe his feelings were genuine and honest (when I expressed my doubts), given the ultimate boyfriend experience, promises and plans were made, etc. My walls eventually came down, I was vulnerable and opened my heart, only to end up crushed and feeling used. It's one thing to allow yourself to have a cute travel romance knowing it's temporary and another to be lied to and have your emotions toyed with. Men are gross and will do anything to sleep with you and then wonder why women get cynical. You're allowed to feel the way you do. Don't be too hard on yourself, and just take it as another life lesson.",
      "Take it and relish it for what it was. A lovely vacation romance. I understand your disappointment but don\u2019t let it ruin what was great about the times with him. If your trip was enhanced by meeting him it was a bonus. If not, and it\u2019s more pain than joy, lesson learned\u2026. No travel romances.",
      "Hi OP, I'm very sorry for how things ended up so bitter!\n\nAs you wrote, this has been your first travel romance, and if you intend to keep travelling (I hope you do!), there will be many more romances on your way, it's kind of unavoidable. For the next ones, though, you might be already more prepared and cautious.\n\nI've been in a long distance relationship for nearly one year in the past, we met in her first night in my previous city. She was there for work and remained over for three weeks, and we lived like boyfriend and girlfriend from day one until she left, meeting in 18 days out of the 21 - there was no time to waste. I lived in Europe, she in Central America. We met a couple of times again across the months, but eventually communication issues while far away made it impossible for us to keep together. It's not impossible to plan a life together while living far distantly, but it requires a lot of sacrifices, planning, honesty and efforts, and not everyone is willing to go through all that.\n\nIf in the next weeks you keep feeling heartbroken and hurt, I'd suggest you write him a message explaining how you felt. This is not for him, it's for you. Taking things out of your heart and chest are usually very beneficial and might make you feel better.\n\nAll the best \ud83c\udf40",
      "Aww, it\u2019s normal to feel a little crushed at the ending. But it reads like you both had a nice time. All good things come to an end. Just enjoy the experience for what it was. Some romances are brief and will probably be the most memorable too. You\u2019ll have stories to tell your grandchildren someday. Or nieces and nephews.",
      "Just reframe it all - don't get down on yourself. This was a great travel adventure. When you're older you'll look back on a travel romance fondly. He wasn't forthcoming, you wanted a little more, but so what. It was fun and exciting and better than spending those days alone on the trip. Flip the perspective from self blame and sadness to a fun adventure where you got taken for a fun little ride."

      "Cape Town has a great mixture of both nature activities and seeing a cool city. I got a good taste of both when I was in Chiang Mai too.",
      "Taipei! It's not quite wilderness-type nature but you can take the subway straight to hiking trails in the mountains surrounding the city.",
      "Sydney! Great city that I really enjoyed just walking around, and you can also access lots of cool nature really close by - beaches and shoreline are transit accessible too which is great. And I believe there are some pretty great day trips nearby too.",
      "Slovenia: While Ljubljana is no metropolis, it's a nice city to explore, very walkable. The great thing is that it's a perfect base camp to explore the beautiful nature. If you like to hike, Triglav National Park is like an hour away by car. If you'd rather go to the beach, Piran or Koper are just over an hour away. But there are also plenty of great places closer to the city.\n\n\nMilan: I was there just a few weeks ago - amazing city, much greener than I thought. You can easily do day trip to the north for more nature, like to Lake Como or even into Switzerland.\n\n\nCalifornia: This might take a little longer to explore, but the mix of large cities and breathtaking National Parks is crazy. Sure, you'll need to drive a fair bit, but it's worth it.",
      "Stockholm Sweden, hands down the best combo I've ever experienced of these things.  I lived there for two summers and a winter.\n\nSome of the best things about it is that everyone speaks English very well, and the public transportation is epic, you can take the municipal busses all the way out to Tyresta nationalpark, or take decently affordable ferries out to the close by archipelago!  (Very affordable if you compare with some more expensive destinations)\n\n*Edit* a lot of people are saying Vancouver, and they are not wrong.  I've been there several times and it's pretty epic as well, there is vast access to the outdoors and it's a cool city.  \n\nAlso, Anchorage Alaska, very close to where I live, is worth a mention. The city isn't that cool in comparison to all these other ones, and the public transportation sucks, but the sheer amount of epic nature nearby more than makes up for all that!\n\nAlthough since it's the combination you are seeking, Oslo, Norway, and in my opinion especially Stockholm Sweden... absolutely worth it!!!",
      "Definitely Vancouver, BC. A coastal city with beaches and mountains around. You can Ski in the morning, go to the beach in the afternoon, and go hiking evening in one day( mild weather there); all within a distance of 30 minutes. it\u2019s one of the rarest that have the combo of city vibe and nature\u2019s beauty.",
      "Salzburg, Austria. Great city with even better nature in the surrounding Salzkammergut regions of the Alps.",
      "San Francisco / Bay Area \n\ni am surprised no one has said this yet! 3 major cities near eachother - SF, Oakland, Santa Cruz, with areas like Monterey or Napa Valley within 2 hours driving distance.\n\nincredible amounts of hiking, forest, mountains, bluffs, coastline, beaches\n\nwithin SF alone there is an amazing mix of nature and city with many parks surrounding the city",
      "Munich is pretty good at incorporating green spaces and waterways, and the city is surrounded by mountains and forests. Vienna very much feels like you're in nature",
      "Easily Vancouver, Canada. The city is practically intertwined with nature- lots of green spaces in the city, and also lots of nature-only things to do just outside the city",
      "Helsinki, Finland, is not just city and nature its like they city in nature :) Everything is kinda blended together, people are chill, transportation is great. Wanna go somwhere? With a couple trams/busses you can reach city or nature in no time. City is not definitely no Las Vegas but everything can be found as in other cities. Nature is lovely! I visited this city for the last 8-9 years every year and im in love with it, would move there in a heartbeat if chance came.",
      "Seattle! There's so much to do in the city, and the Pacific Northwest has some of the most incredible nature in the world in my opinion. The mountains, lakes, pine, and fog are so stunning.\n\nIn a similar vein, Vancouver.",
      "Vancouver British Columbia is where you want to be.\n\nThere are mountains, beaches, and great camping spots all which are all less than hour away from the city.\n\nThe city itself has a little big city vibe. It has everything you would want in a city from breweries, restaurants and nightclubs to art centers, events and concerts. But it still a small city compared to Toronto, New York, London etc.\n\nAs far as nature and nature activities go, this is the city for it. The city is full of people who organize meetup groups or Facebook groups to go skiing hiking, rock climbing etc. There's tons of places to rent out the gear as well. One thing is I'd make sure you but our import your car as it opens up so many opportunities. \n\nIf you end up choosing Vancouver make sure you come on the tail end of Spring as the rest of the year it's usually raining. Summers in Vancouver are just the best",
      "Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nAmazing city, great food, great people, right next to the rocky mountains, right next to the ocean, right next to various forests.\n\nIts absolutely gorgeous. I honestly dont think there is a city on the planet that has a better city-life/nature balance.",
      "I suppose you want a place that is relatively safe, that has a city atmosphere and good public transportation system so you can easily move from the center to the countryside. I would suggest larger cities in Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic or Slovakia. \n\nExtremely low crime rate, working and in many cases cheap public transport and near each city there are several places worth visiting, be it a beautiful piece of nature or a cultural landmark - for example a day trim from Prague can be the absolutely amazing ossuary in Sedlec (Kutna Hora), or unbelievable Predjama Castle from Ljubljana.",
      "I'd say Rio for the natural setting, Seattle for the day trips (summer only), Manaus for the intensity of nature, Sichuan province for harmony with nature (with odd contradictions).",
      "Hong Kong has amazing variety. Incredible nature, hikes, water sports etc and big city environment all within 20 minutes of each other",
      "Fun fact, Portland has one of the largest urban nature parks in the US.  Literally called Forest Park...  It's very close to downtown.",
      "I'm surprised no one has mentioned L.A. Although not a top notch travel destination per se as it is so sparse and public transportation is fairly non existent, but that's one person's opinion. And you pretty much need a car to get around or Uber, there are a lot of options for nature. Assuming you were looking to L.A as travel destination, which a lot of people do, and it is really, on any given day, depending on time of year, you can wake up in downtown L.A and drive 30-45 minutes and go surfing, then have tacos, and drive another 2-2.5 hours and go snow boarding in the mountains. People do this, not for the sake of saying they did it, but they love to surf and snowboard.",
      "Switzerland as a whole. Zurich especially has good nightlife in the city and great nature trails just an hour away by public transport.",
      "St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland & Labrador. Cute, colourful city with world class trails and nature just outside of the downtown core. I went on a three hour ecotour in Witless Bay (just outside of St. John\u2019s) this July, and saw dozens of humpback whales, a few eagles, and millions of seabirds! Icebergs can also be seen from downtown core most years, which is a pretty cool experience for most tourists.",
      "Valdivia and Chilo\u00e9 in Chile. Beautiful architecture, lots of nature",
      "Vancouver is like this, but personally I didn't like it much. Both the city and the nature were kind of meh.\nAnd I think Croatia is good for nature (there's a beautiful natural park there) and cities (dubrovnik is beautiful!) and seaside too.",
      "Damn this is a great question. I did the bulk of my traveling in the USA and most great national parks are fairly isolated. San Francisco isn\u2019t terrible far from cool nature trails  and Vancouver/Paris were great cities for bicycling if that counts lol",
      "Wow, super cool to see someone with the same taste. I always love planning travels around some kind of nature (usually a national park or unique geographic area) and urban spoils.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would say Seattle heavily fits the bill for this. While the city itself has a couple of fun places (perfect for a day's worth of sightseeing), much of the charm lies outside the city in Mt Rainier, Olympics or Cascades. Bonus points for the Columbia river gorge and Mt st helens. Idk your timing though, it may be fall but the parks are beginning to shutter for the winter so maybe not now.\n\nOther cities in the US (I'll admit my knowledge of this style of travel is a bit more rusty outside of it) that fit this would include:\n\nOthers have already mentioned Portland for obvious reasons\n\nVegas: Zion, Grand Canyon, Death Valley. Probably more heavily affected by covid than most places.\n\nDenver: rockies and environs (maroon bells, dunes, etc)\n\nDC: Shenandoah, Blue Ridge mtns. Highly contingent on how much of a museum/history person you are, but likely the least affected overall by covid (in terms of things to see that haven't had full-fledged closures)\n\nMiami: Everglades, Biscayne, Key West and its ilk. Highly contingent on how much of a tropical fun in sun person you are.\n\nHawaii: This really should be self explanatory, albeit similar to the above.\n\nSF/LA: this one's a bit weaker in terms of \u2264 3 hr proximity to unique natural areas but I'm including it because I love California fiercely and driving down the west coast should be a bucket list item for everyone. The Marin Headlands are also my favorite place to be alone in the whole world. Maybe with the exception of the La Jolla cliffs if someone isn't proposing.\n\nLondon+Scottish highlands: Ok, this one's straight up a stretch, but saying it nonetheless. Crucify me as needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut like i said earlier, this is super reliant on when you're planning on going, since some are better at different seasons on the other. Hope this helped!",
      "Tokyo. Most people don't venture outside of a handful of central spots and think its just a mega city with an urban sprawl issue, devoid of nature but a short train ride and you are in the mountains at places like Mount Takao or on sandy beaches like Enoshima.\n\nSure you have the big Yamanote Line areas like Harajuku, Ueno, Asakusa, Akihabara, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro which make it an interesting city, but you are out in the sticks if you hop on one of the many cheap local trains to Chiba or Saitama.",
      "Berlin, Germany! Lots of grafitti/city buildings but so much beautiful trees and nature everywhere as you pass through. There's even a body of water by the Berlin Wall!",
      "San Francisco.  \n\nNature in the city : Golden Gate Park, The Presidio, Ocean Beach, Lands' End.    \n\nNature outside the city : Marin Headlands, Muir Woods, Mt. Tamalpais.",
      "Tacoma and Olympia Washington. The best way to describe it, Seattle is surrounded by nature. While Tacoma and Olympia have multiple forests located within the city. I mean real old growth forests.",
      "If you want a blend of nature in a city with loads of smaller islands and other countries to visit, Singapore is not a bad shout.",
      "Valencia! \nA massive park runs through the centre of the city on a riverbed that was diverted. One end goes to the beach and the other end a nature reserve. The graffiti is pretty epic in the old town too!",
      "Burlington Vermont! It's a smaller city but surrounded by great nature stuff",
      "Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA, and Vancouver, BC are a few top cities that come to mind... great to venture to these city/nature areas during lower season times with less tourism/traffic, better lodging rates, etc. Try going in late spring, May, or late summer, Sept! \n\nI keep hearing Sydney, Australia is a great city with amazing nature to check out as well!",
      "Phoenix, Arizona. I don't know if anyone mentioned it so far as I'm not going to scroll thru 134 more replies. The city itself has the Desert Botanical Garden and the Japanese Friendship Garden. Also there is a very good zoo. There are lots of nature parks within the city and further afield spectacular desert and mountain scenery. Day/Weekend trips would be to Tucson, Prescott, Sedona or Flagstaff. It's warm even in winter but go in April when the desert wildflowers bloom. You'll need a car if you venture outside the city."

But I didn\u2019t realise how much I craved a partner until this trip. Seeing couples travelling together I feel so jealous. Back home I live in a pretty smallish town and it feels impossible to meet anyone decent, the good ones are all taken it seems. Everyone my age (30) is settled down, having kids. I don\u2019t think I want children and it seems like every man I meet is in that stage of wanting kids too. So I think I secretly hoped I would meet someone who wants the same things as me travelling. But instead I think most guys here are just wanting something casual and to have fun. \n\nLast year I did a 6 week trip to Thailand and had fun and wasn\u2019t against fleeting romances. But even there, where hookup culture was strong, it still felt like the guys were open to travelling together for a week or two and wanted something abit more than just a hookup. But not here (Central America) which is surprisingly. I feel like every person I\u2019m attracted to isn\u2019t into me and the guys who are, I\u2019m not attracted to them. I\u2019ve had a few rejections, a guy I was into ghosted me today. And I know these guys are essentially strangers and I shouldn\u2019t let it bother me, but it does. I guess I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any tips on how to not put too much expectations on to people and how to detach and move past rejection? \n\nI can feel my confidence growing on this trip and it\u2019s a really nice feeling. I\u2019m becoming more confident within myself, learning to trust my instincts and enjoying my own company. But rejection still seems to be something I\u2019m not great at navigation yet.

      "If I can give my two cents. As a 28M who solo traveled for 18 months. I ended those travels with a partner now of almost two years. So I believe real romance is possible while traveling. However, I think finding it with fellow TRAVELERS is a daunting task. One I found pretty hopeless. My partner lived in the city I was slow traveling in a recent transplant to the city herself. I personally found other travelers to be generally unserious people when it came to romance and relationships. Made some real lifelong friends tho.",
      "I don\u2019t think travel is the ideal way to find a partner if you\u2019re looking for anything beyond hookups or short-term flings. The transient, carefree nature of travel is in itself already at odds with the type of connection that you\u2019re hoping to find.\n\nMy dating life is firmly entrenched at home, and my partner and I travel together. When each of us travels alone or with other people (never for super long periods, e.g. months), I know he\u2019s back home waiting for me. That\u2019s the ideal setup for me because I prioritise being in a stable long-term relationship.",
      "Trying to hook up with everyone you meet while traveling, while fun, is very much a young person\u2019s game. Most people who are traveling through South America aren\u2019t looking for a romantic partner there. If a travel romance happens, it\u2019s a big plus, but if you are having multiple instances of rejection in just a few weeks I think you need to shift your focus to something else.",
      "I have found that travelers in Central America tend to be older than those in South East Asia; not overrun by teens drinking every possible second. So maybe its that the younger mindset/relationship experience of Southeast Asia travelers vs Central America are causing the difference in culture you have observed? I mean older people tend to have a better grasp on what they want and like and don't stick around for stuff they think will waste their time; like kids or nah. They are more likely to have a job/established life at home. Different travel mindset.\n\nIf you make the big reason you travel is meeting other travelers and finding a relationship/romance, that may be putting too much expectation on yourself and the trip and it may end up being unenjoyable. Of course meeting others are part of the fun of travel, but sometimes you meet people you click with and other times you go on long droughts. If their expectations/desires don't line up with yours, then just do your best not to invest your emotions into it.  Sometimes moving onto the next destination can help or just meeting new people. Do a fun activity. In the end, I think of finding a partner as a bonus if it happens. I think your mindset going into the trip is putting too much expectation on yourself to finding someone and not allowing you to just have fun. If possible, maybe move from your small town?",

      "You can spend a week at Elephant Nature Park in Chang Mai, Thailand for around that cost, if I remember correctly. I have done a lot of rugged traveling and hiking and nature stuff all over the world, and it stands out as the most holistically rounded, good week of my life. That place is just doing things right. It's a sanctuary for formerly abused elephants. \n\nFirst, tourists like me (and you!) pay for the experience, which gives the sanctuary money and us tourists a wonderful experience. You feed the elephants which is super fun, and you wade into the river with them and throw buckets of water on them and scrub their skin. The mahouts (a human who is paired with the elephant to care for it and guide it) are refugees from neighboring Myanmar which gives them a job and the elephants a friend! You also shovel elephant poo every day, which is nice and humbling.\n\nSome days we would load into a truck and get taken to a field where we did very hard dirty sweaty scrapey work of using machetes to chop down (I'm embarrassed I forget what plant...sugar cane maybe?) for the elephants to eat. Another day we went to a hill tribe school to \"teach English\" (actually goof around and play soccer with) the local kids. Another day we spent the morning planting tree saplings on the sanctuary grounds.\n\nThe food is delicious and cooked by local old ladies. I did an optional trek to a platform in the jungle, where we slept overnight one night. The trek is more for the elephants than the humans, so that they have a chance to forage the naturally growing plants. On that overnight the mahouts cooked dinner with supplies and food they packed in. I asked if I could help and they gave me garlic and a mortar and pestle to mash it up in.  Sitting there on a platform up in the jungle, with grazing elephants around, using a mortar and pestle to help Burmese refugees cook dinner was one of those very special moments that was like eating a wild strawberry.\n\nOther highlights included watching a veterinarian help the elephants with injuries, including putting a prosthetic foot on an elephant that had stepped on a landmine, and speaking with a grad student who was there doing behavioral research. I also remember one of the mahouts writing me a love poem and shyly giving it to me. Oh oh! And I witnessed an epic battle between a ginormous centipede and....fuck I can't remember what the other insect was. But I mean this centipede was like a foot long and 2-3 inches wide with its giant legs. And it was fighting with some other similarly sized giant insect, dang I can't believe I forget now what it was. They were in the wall of the shared bathroom! I didn't have a phone on this trip, believe it or not. I was there in 2008. I hope the place is just as amazing now as it was back then.\n\nI don't know why I haven't gone back yet, I gotta get on that.",

Otherwise head south just across the border to Mexico which also has several retreats for spiritual connection, most of them of psychedelic nature. But honestly you already have it all in the US. There is no shortage of wilderness escapes and friendly people. Just take a car and follow serendipity",

    "selftext": "I [mid-20s F North America] spent the winter holidays on my own abroad last year and met a lovely person [late-20s M Central Europe] on, as life would have it, my last evening. We met on a dating app, and I had one of the top 3 best dates of my life with him. We got to speak in his native language, there was lots of laughter and eye contact and flirtatious teasing, and he kept putting off his train back home so that we could hang out for longer. I flew back home the next day, and the conversation eventually died out. I got pretty sad about it, but as my school term and internship started back up, I was able to accept the separation as a sweet memory and move on.\n\nFast-forward to the era of sheltering and social distancing. I live alone, which I enjoy, but I find that this setup makes it easier to ruminate on what could've been with this person. To add to that, I had booked a 6-week summer school program in his country of residence before the travel restrictions were put in place. I day(and night)dream about getting a WhatsApp message from him asking me how it's going, how I'm coping during this time, then setting up a Zoom call, excitedly dressing up for the call, having a call that lasts as long as our date did, and so on. You get the idea.\n\nI no longer have his number but I remember his Instagram handle. I know I won't reach out. (A friend told me, \"It's called a love letter, not a love DM.\") I think I'll simply hold these thoughts tenderly and not be mad at myself for having them\u2014we are in a fucking pandemic\u2014while also remembering that I have a life here and that things just don't work out sometimes for one reason or another. Ah, well.\n\nApologies if travel romance posts aren't appropriate for this sub. Just wondering whether any of my fellow solo travelers are feeling the same and how you are managing the thoughts and feelings!\n\nWishing you all safety and health during this time.

It was my first time in London last spring and I'd gotten last minute tickets to see Phantom of the Opera at its original theatre. Standing in the lobby I'd made eye contact with a guy who seemed alone as well, but I doubted he was! The chances of us being able to sit with each other seemed ridiculously low anyways, so I put it out of my head.\n\nWhen the doors opened for the audience to find their seats, I made my way in first. About ten minutes later... Guess who excuses himself to come sit right next to me! I forget who made the first comment, but we immediately hit it off chatting about where we were from, our interests, our love for the arts. I was starstruck. The dude even smelled good.\n\nWe talked the entire waiting time before the show started, through intermission, and then he practically jumped out of his seat and ran off the moment the lights turned back on.

      "Two years ago, I had my five month internship at Vietnam. I was the only foreigner around the neighborhood that time. But then after a month of living in VN, I found this coffee shop which played English songs and sold french fries and burger and milk tea and coffee and stuffs so I decided to make that place my hangout place before I go to work in the afternoon. There's this guy who works there either as a cashier or the server. He was really cute and tall and he always goofed around with the other workers (though I cant understand what they were saying). The first time I ordered, there was someone else on the counter. She had a hard time understanding what I was saying because I figured maybe she had little English, and I couldnt do any conversational Vietnamese. And so this girl called the cute guy to take my order as he was probably the only one who could understand English. He was patient in understanding what I was saying but he always had a smile on his face despite the language barrier. \n\nI became a regular in their shop and everytime I'd enter, he would always acknowledge me by smiling, even if we didnt say anything to each other. He would sometimes be the one to take my order (and when he does, he would be the one to ask if I will be ordering the chocolate boba with extra pearl and pudding again because it's my favorite) and sometimes, he would serve it to me. Our conversations would just revolve around him taking my orders, him asking if the food was great, him asking if I was American or what. \n\nThis went on for five months. I was happy because despite being homesick and all with literally no one to engage a lengthy normal English conversation with, I had this cute crush over a guy. \n\nIt was my last day and tomorrow, I'll be flying back home. I was ready to say my goodbye to this guy and tell him I'll be going home tomorrow. But sadly, on my last day on their shop, he was off duty. I ended up saying goodbye to the rest of the workers in the shop as they'd known me for a while too. I was feeling a bit sad over that last day on the coffee shop. Finally, on the day I was to go home, my boss took me with her to the market to run a quick errand and we rode her motorcycle. We stopped by a red light and more motorcycles were next to us and behind us. When all of a sudden, a delivery motorcycle from the coffee shop pulled up next to us. And then I noticed it was the cute guy! He noticed me as well and acknowledged me once again with his nod and smile. It was pretty quick tho as the light turned green and my boss went right, and he took left. \n\nIt was just a wholesome moment and did not rly blossomed into a romance. But everytime I remember it, it just felt cute and nice and all that."

      "A beautiful boy/man with impossibly curly eyelashes and a face splitting smile in Sri Lanka.\n\nRaw and sore from a really messy break up.\n\nA beach with sand like talcum powder, impossible shades of turquoise and blue sea.\n\nHe was a guide at the nearby National Park and as a result was also that sexiest of males because he was doing something he passionate about.  He used to come to the restaurant bar I frequented in the evenings and play guitar with the locals and just chill in the evenings.\n\nKind of cynical about the come to bed gaze because there were a number of older European women around with obvious 'beach boy' playthings.  All adults but the transactional nature was obvious and confronting.\n\nHe asked to sit with me one night and I was wary AF but we began to talk and he definitely was not pushy but made it clear he was interested.  The next day he turned up early in the afternoon and talked me into joining a trip into the National Park on a twilight drive. AMAZING. The jeeps are rented out by passenger but he had this one client who paid for the entire jeep and then had cancelled so I had my own personal guide and jeep.  And it was magic!  He wouldn't accept payment because he had already been paid but agreed to have dinner with me that night as a thank you.\n\nWe talked to the early hours and he walked me back to my guesthouse and we did kiss.\n\nThe following night he took me to a beach to watch turtles laying eggs and work with volunteers to collect eggs to prevent predation.\n\nEarly one morning he arranged for us to go out with the fishermen at dawn and watch the blue whales and eat roasted prawns over charcoal afterwards\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was sweet and more about soul than sex.  He drove me to the station on my last morning and we said farewell.  He had given me back my smile and my trust in myself by simply being who he was.\n\nHe is now married with two small children in a country in total disarray but I know our friendship has lasted and his children are being looked after by a small fund set up by some friends and I.",

      "Mine was kind of a failed romance but this European German guy (super friendly and kind, also muscular and good looking) pretty much sat with me in the canteen and made a real effort to talk with me. I\u2019m British and wasn\u2019t really used to it. I\u2019m also male and homosexual - and I assumed he was just being European. \n\nWe basically became hostel friends but I assumed he was straight. Missed a lot of cues! At one point we were queueing for showers and he was basically only wearing a towel completely ripped waving at me trying to get my attention and I didn\u2019t know where to look and kinda pretended I hadn\u2019t heard him \ud83d\ude2d He also invited me to a garden place but I bailed because I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. (I realise this sounds bad, I had no confidence)\n\nI did like him but assumed he was straight and didn\u2019t want to put myself in a weird situation.\n\nAnyway we agreed to go on a road trip with two other people. It was fun and I feel there were opportunities I missed to make it happen but had NO IDEA.\n\nAnyway, I went to New Zealand and he messaged me asking if i wanted to go to Cambodia with him. I was about to head home so wasn\u2019t sure - it was bad timing. \n\nA year later he messages me and admitted he had feelings for me. I was like \u201cDAMMIT!!\u201d Then not much later he admitted he now had a boyfriend (who seems a bit jealous, but it\u2019s not my business). I\u2019m gutted I missed out on it but it was a huge lesson learned. I don\u2019t take risks and miss out on good things. From now on I will be brave and try to see where life takes me. And be more confident in myself etc!",

I had met two really sweet girls on the first night at the hostel but the next night they were super tired and headed to bed early. I was about to do the same because I didn\u2019t know anyone else when this really cute guy \u201cbumped\u201d into me while walking over to the bar. \nSo I walked over and her bought me a beer and we spent the entire night talking about everything. Then at around 1 am he decided to try to take me outside to teach me to ride a bike (I hadn\u2019t yet learned which is embarrassing) but the bike garage was locked up so we went for a walk and he kissed me by the water. It was so sweet and romantic. \nWe basically had a mini relationship for the rest of our time there. He was the sweetest guy. But then I went back to Spain and he went back to Italy. \nWe are still sporadically in touch and I would definitely see him if we were in the same city again. \nI honestly love a little travel romance. I just also think the right expectations are important. Yeah, you hear those stories about people meeting the love of their life. But more often than not, you\u2019ll have a fling for a week or whatever, end on good terms, and view eachother\u2019s insta stories until the day you die. But that doesn\u2019t erase the magic of the memories of it all",

      "No romance here, just flirtatious fun and a bit of good old fashioned lust, but on my last trip to Italy, after I bid goodbye to a little Tinder fling that had spent the night with me, I went sightseeing around Florence and randomly met a guy from Sweden. We went to a karaoke bar later that night where we drank and sang for a couple of hours before parting ways; minutes later, as I was walking to my hotel, a cute guy in a Vespa asked me if I wanted to go for a drive with him; he drove us all around Florence at midnight, up and down little streets - stopping to make out on the way ofc -, he showed me some amazing views and he even let me drive the vespa for a while! Still one of my favourite memories from my trip. Afterwards he dropped me off near my hotel where I had a Tinder hook-up waiting for me. Finally, after my guy left, the hotel manager opened a bottle of wine for us in the reception, something from one of his friends\u2019 vineyard, and said if I was tired he\u2019d be more than happy to give me a massage\u2026 Had to decline and end my night there, but boy was I glad to have brought extra chapstick with me.  \n\nTinder is great for this! I suggest you start using the passport feature a couple of weeks before your trip so you have time to set up dates and weed-out the bad matches."

    "selftext": "Hi, I'm a 24-year-old female, and I am 17 days into a 7 week solo trip in Europe. I just was sick with the flu for 4 days and now I feel better physically but I can't stop crying. I am currently in Seville, Spain and I have gone out to see the sights and it's all the same compared to the last few cities I've been. Each day is crowded streets, the same European buildings, buy buy buy, shopping and big cities that all feel identical. I was having such a good time before I got sick but then I lost my voice and couldn't talk to people. Now I haven't connected with many people but when I do I just break down and cry to them. My flight home isn't until March 12, and when I go home I also have nothing waiting for me, no job, no community, no guidance on my next steps, So I'm at a loss and I don't know what to do. I am sick of wandering around and just existing rather than enjoying myself no matter how much I try. I have made sure I have been doing non-touristy things such as yoga, going to the gym and taking nights to watch Netflix, but the tears won't stop. Money isn't an issue at the moment so I could go home whenever but I'm worried I'll regret it if I leave but also worried I will regret staying and being so sad. I know the only person who can decide what to do is me but I can't tell if I'm just giving up when things get hard or if I am being too hard on myself trying to have the \"perfect trip\". But I guess I don't even know what I truly want right now so I guess it's between being sad in Europe or sad at home. \n\nEDIT. UPDATE.\n\nI have been at a loss for words these past few weeks. When I expressed my vulnerable emotions on the internet, I never expected this sort of response. Recently I even saw someone wrote a news article about this post too. Since comments were disabled I am editing my OG post and hoping the hundreds of people who commented and offered support see this and know I thank them and appreciate them for their advice. I wanted to start by saying that I was not mentally or physically feeling like myself when I posted this, and looking back l know that my emotions got the best of me and it\u2019s not about where I was in terms of location. I fully recognize my privilege to experience this trip and it was insensitive to complain about something that\u2019s such a first world problem especially with all the global hardships currently happening. Secondly, yes I am still travelling! I genuinely took the time to read everyone\u2019s comments and private messages I received and lots of things really helped me through that low moment. Nothing like the power of strangers on the internet coming together for someone they don\u2019t even know \u2764\ufe0f I have always dreamed of travelling solo for a long time and I would\u2019ve been very upset with myself if I gave up. Not giving up when things got hard made this experience that much more meaningful. To anyone that reads this post and feels the same way, please take all of this advice and DO NOT GIVE UP. I took a lot of peoples advice and changed the entire rest of my trip. \nFor those curious: I started by de stressing in AIRE ancient baths the next day and it was 10/10, it really calmed me down. Next I ended up making some friends in my hostel and doing lots of fun things like flamenco shows and food touring around Sevilla, it truly is a magical place and I would recommend everyone spend some time in any one of the cities in the Andalusian region. Next I went on a hike on part of the Camino trail up a mountain outside of Madrid. Never underestimate how much power nature can hold for you. Finally, I am now on a farm in the Italian countryside where I am volunteering and living for the next few weeks and I feel at home and at peace with my experience so far. Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to reach out and offer advice and support. I received hundreds of messages and I physically could not respond.\nAdditionally, since it is the internet there was some rude comments and questions and I just wanted to touch on a few for my own personal sake even though I don\u2019t need to. I have been dealing with mental health issues for years but I didn\u2019t realize until I was alone for so long how much I avoided rather than resolved. Honestly I think this trip has benefited my mental health as I haven\u2019t been able to hide away from my problems. Also I\u2019m the type of person who used to choose to let mental illness stop them from living their life and it made it worse. Truthfully, i have been in therapy and think it\u2019s a great idea for everyone to do and I know that I need more of it. Another thing is I have worked multiple jobs since I was 16, and saved up a lot of money, invested, and worked for this experience all on my own (not that I need to defend that to people, but I don\u2019t like the thought of people thinking I\u2019ve been given some golden ticket when in reality I worked really hard to be here). Lastly, I made it seem that I have a bad support system at home and have no one but that\u2019s not true and it came across poorly during my moment of weakness. I have many friends, and family members who love and support me but didn\u2019t entirely understand what I was going through in that moment so it felt like I didn\u2019t have anyone. Anyways, this trip has been the most difficult, amazing, important, eye-opening experience I\u2019ve ever had and now I don\u2019t want it to end. I am grateful for all of the ups and downs and if you find yourself so fortunate, everyone should experience a solo travel trip at least once in their lifetime. ",

      "Traveling solo can bring up mysterious emotions! Don\u2019t get discouraged. (Also recovering from the flu anywhere is enough to mess with your state of mind.) If your surroundings are starting to feel uninspired, try something different\u2014head out to nature or the countryside and try a change of pace. Rent a bicycle or crack open a good book. I prefer traveling solo in less populated areas to being alone in cities\u2014sometimes seeing so many other people in groups can make me feel lonely when hiking up a mountain alone can feel fun and exciting. But don\u2019t jump to the conclusion that you need to come home. Ride it out a little, and don\u2019t be afraid to lean into your emotions and let them wash over you. Being alone and getting through a challenge (even an internal challenge) is such a great experience. And remember you have agency\u2014if you aren\u2019t happy in the place you\u2019re visiting, move onto the next. You\u2019re not the first person to feel this way on a big trip! Take some comfort in that. Good luck out there!!",
      "I solo traveled for 4 years in my 20s. I cannot tell you how many times I cried myself to sleep. I found getting a routine helped the most. I love checking out libraries, walking or hiking, and nature. When in a new place I'd first establish a fav coffee shop or eating spot, this gives you a sense of residency.  It helps with the aimless feeling. I'd visit the library to use wifi, it's a low pressure place where you aren't forced to buy coffee to stay. I'd plan a 1-2 hour walking tour to check out things that interest me. If you have a kitchen, plan dinner and cook. It takes up time and is usually healthier.",

      "Hello, thank you for sharing your experience. I\u2019m crying with joy from all of the compassion you sparked - nearly 250 people wanting to help you in such a short time!  I have two reactions - are you overwhelmed by the length of your trip?  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever tried to handle 7 weeks of anything at one time - much less tried to enjoy all that time!  When I\u2019m that sad, I start free-writing (by hand) in a journal (see Writing Down The Bones by Natalie Goldberg). The pen slows me to pay attention to my heart and to express everything I\u2019m sad about. That helps me become more clear about what IS actually going on with me and what I need and want instead of staying stuck in my thoughts about what I believe \u201cshould\u201d be happening or what I imagine others would be enjoying. It\u2019s an equally (sometimes more) valuable and important inner \u201cjourney\u201d of being with myself. I\u2019m 65 and felt some of your \u201cwant to go home\u201d when I arrived in New Orleans for a 4-day weekend- so I can fathom 7 weeks on my own!  Nomadic Matt has a wonderful post about  this solo travel experience (https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/going-home/) that taught me how traveling gets me out of my comfort zones so I can find out what I\u2019m capable of doing on my own. My trips are starting to become my best mirror of who I actually am rather than who I can convince myself I am in the familiar routines at home. I suggest free-writing without any alcohol or other substances so you can get a clear view that isn\u2019t influenced by chemicals. Also, maybe a massage or some other body work to flush out all of the emotions. Crying is like a thundershower for me. When it\u2019s finished, I have the calm and the silence that\u2019s in nature. Another amazing resource is Anne Lamott\u2019s Bird By Bird. Sending you compassion and encouragement for your inner as well as outer journey!",

Take really good care of yourself and indulge in come comforting and familiar things. Also, if you\u2019re sick or city centers that are all the same, skip them! Use YouTube or TikTok to look up less common sights and attractions. \n\nThen, when you\u2019re ready to be social again, I\u2019ve always had the best luck meeting people when staying at the nicer hostels and going on some of their tours, pub crawls, or events. \n\nGood luck and be kind to yourself.",

But you need to cover a long distance in short time , yeah you have no other option. But maximum i suggest a trustable legitimate driver \n2)destination : don't worry about your destination , you must cover backwater , beach , hill stations \nIf you're plan have this 3 then it is okey \n3)you will get a lot of suggestions in Google and Google map , you need to combine your Google map with local knowledge (they are safe and majority know English) mainly trust Google map and ask locals for support , there is a lot yoga centre in kochi , I seen a video of foreigner teaching yoga \n4)break fast , there is a lot of hotels and restaurants and you can trust them , but I will suggest \n    a) ask locals about best hotel food \n    b) gmap to verify and check whether you like the atmosphere \n5) The chances that you will get scammed and stolen is very very very low , you can just leave it anywhere and it will be there unless someone take it given it to police thinking it is lost , but it is not worth taking risk so there will be local setup , like if you are staying near beach , there will be staffs helping you out and lot \nI can't say definitely where to keep them , you want to find a place momentarily, and don't worry it is genuinely safe \n\nI have other recommendations \n\n*) kerala locals don't try to help you unless you ask in majority situation.

      "Ecuador would be a good choice too. It\u2019s pretty small, but it has many different types of climate like beaches, mountains, cloud forests, and jungle. Since the country is pretty small, you can get to all of these places in a relatively short time. You could go from being on a beach in the morning to being on the edge of the Amazon by evening/nighttime. It doesn\u2019t have as many ruins as Peru does, but it still has some worth checking out. Quito has some great colonial architecture, and Cuenca has some cool Incan-era architecture as well as a great museum. \n\nAlso look into Ba\u00f1os and Mindo. Both have some really cool nature around them and tons of activities to do. \n\nI was there a few years ago, so I don\u2019t know how it is during COVID, but it\u2019s definitely one of the coolest places I\u2019ve been. (Although I do love Colombia and Peru)",
      "I backpacked through Central and South America in 2019, and there are a few countries with really awesome nature spots and ruins. Where you got is going to be totally dependent on what type of nature  you want to see. See below for my thoughts on some of the countries I recommend: \n\nGuatemala (ruins/volcanos): I've found this country to have the best ruins. Tikal was awesome and a must see. You also have the opportunity to see some pretty epic Volcanos. You can climb Acatenango and see the erupting Volcan de Fuego from the top. You can also climb the tallest volcano in Central America Tajumulco. \n\nMexico (ruins/beach): I've only been to Merida on the Yucatan and didn't get a chance to go to Chichen Itza but you'll also find some ruins at Tulum there. If you travel further away than the Yucatan, you can see some awesome ruins at Palenque and these were a highlight for me. I wish I also went to Tabasco to see the Olmec heads (not ruins but ancient objects worth seeing).\n\nBelize: Is this technically Latin America? No Spanish is spoken here as it used to be an English colony. If you are looking for amazing scuba diving and reefs and sea life you'll find it here. I was so surprised to dive and not come into contact with any plastic in the water. There's also some ruins further inland.\n\nCosta Rica: some of the best preserved nature in Latin America. Lot's of opportunities to see rare wildlife, birds of paradise, I met some folks that have even seen jaguars while travelling here.\n\nColombia: Lots of nature and some ruins if you are keen on doing a multiday trek\n\nNicaragua: not sure about ruins but there are some old glyphs you can see on Ometepe as well as volcanos to climb. \n\nEcuador: This is the real winner for nature. You have cloud forest, super high Andes, beach/ tropical, Amazon river basin jungle. This was a big highlight for me. I did not go to the Galapagos but there is also a bastion of nature there as well. \n\nArgentina: No ruins but wow Patagonia. Mountains galore.  \n\nThere are more good options here but I didn't really go to them and don't have a perspective: Nicaragua (good ruins/nature/not good security situation), Peru (ruins/nature), Bolivia, Brazil, etc. \n\n**tl,dr: ultimately it is up to the nature that you want to see. For best nature I would go to Costa Rica or Ecuador. For best nature and ruins I would go to Guatemala. But there are good options in a lot of places, and it's up to you and what you want your experience to look like! Have fun, meet people, learn the history, and take pictures!**",
      "you got a lot of choices.  mountains or jungle? temperate or tropical? people or nature?  there's lots of very beautiful natural areas in Brazil Argentina Chile even Bolivia and Peru.  you could easily spend your entire 2 weeks in the southern cone",
      "Brazil in the Winter (June/July/August) and even in the Spring, Summer or Autumn has the best different types of Nature, so you\u2019d get to know things from snowy mountains of Santa Catarina (in the extreme South) + natural light blue lakes with exotic species of Pantanal Biome in Bonito (State of Mato Grosso do Sul) or maybe even go to Jericoacoara in Cear\u00e1 (State) & surf in the best beaches for kitesurfing. Brazil also has a Rainforest (Amazon), a Semi-Desert (Sert\u00e3o) & even the Biggest Manmade Forest in the World, Floresta da Tijuca (State of Rio de Janeiro). Brazil\u2019s really the most diverse country (of nature and animals) that I know of. I\u2019m Brazilian & I can recommend, we\u2019re of the best places for tourism & hospitality services. We do not speak Spanish as Natives, so keep in mind that the official language is Brazilian Portuguese, but you\u2019ll be well treated & people will speak in \u201cPortunhol\u201d (the mix Brazilians make from Brazilian Portuguese with Espanhol to communicate with other Latin Americans) to you, being that no problem. I hope I\u2019ve helped. If you have any questions, just ask! Brazil is lovely & you\u2019ll definitely like it! :)",
      "Yo, Im from SD as well. I spent a month in Colombia in 2019 and just got back from a week in the Yucatan Peninsula. \n\nThe Colombian coastline has lots of jungle and hikes, you can sleep in hammocks on the beach and take a multi day trek to the Lost City. You could even spend a couple nights in Medellin and take the bus down to Salento. Ill always recommend Colombia for anyone.\n\nTulum and the Riviera Maya are beautiful as well but a lot more touristy. Chichen Itza and the cenotes make it worth it, and only having a week I wasnt even able to see everything I had wanted to. It was also my first non solo trip and to be honest I dont think it would have been as fun if I were on my own. \n\nCosta Rica is next on my list bc I also love the nature and not into the nightlife, You really cant go wrong with any.  Flights from TJ to Cancun or San Jose are roughly the same price, to Medellin you can sometimes find for under $400 round trip as well. Your money will go further in Colombia than the touristy spots of Mex or CR. The only problem I had in Colombia is I wanted to stay forever.",
      "Patagonia in Chile, and to an extent Argentina. You won't find ruins but the nature is absolutely breathtaking.",
      "Yucat\u00e1n no. The cenotes and beach are beautiful but it's a very highly developed area.\n\nColombia is wonderful and where I currently live. Even from Medell\u00edn there is a lot of access to nature, both for day trips or weekends. It's a big county with all sorts of different climates and things to see.\n\nPatagonia is a lot further, the southern part of Argentina but it's highly discounted if you bring USD in cash (you can get 2x the official exchange rate). I also highly recommend Peru, some exceptional hiking both around Cuzco and north of Lima in Huaraz.\n\nIn Central America, I love Guatemala. Watching an active volcano after hiking the Acatenango mountain, Semuc Champay, Lake Atitl\u00e1n and the colonial city of Antigua all really stood out and are not very far from each other. The volcano might be the coolest thing I have done after traveling for years in Latin America.",
      "Peru for sure. Go straight to Huaraz. Incredible nature",
      "I'm really not a fan of the yucatan peninsula because it's extremely touristy and overpriced (I've been about a dozen times now). It's great for those who are into that sort of thing, tulum is maybe the nicest now.\n\nNow if you want nature maybe go to costa rica, colombia, or argentina. I'm in costa rica now and it's been nothing short of unreal.",
      "I think you could pick anywhere and would see beautiful nature! I think the interior and Caribbean coast of Colombia was the most beautiful places I\u2019ve ever been to. I spent three months there a few years ago. Jungle, waterfalls, mountains, and beaches. And the pacific coast of Mexico is incredible.",
      "I know I already mentioned Costa Rica, but you said you liked ruins and nature so I have to also recommend Tikal, Guatemala as the most amazing ruins.  The sheer scale of the city and the size of the pyramids/temples is amazing. And after a few days there go over to Lago Atitlan passing thru Antigua (volcano). Guatemala is also amazing.",
      "I know you speak spanish not portuguese, but Brazil maybe? The country is a corona shithole right now but the people are very, very friendly and being a really big country, nature is very diverse",
      "I live in Yucat\u00e1n and there\u2019s loads of ruins, culture and cenotes but it\u2019s light in hiking and vast nature. For that I\u2019d say Costa Rica or Colombia. Ecuador also sounds amazing but I haven\u2019t been. My friend is buying a hostel in Salento, Colombia and the videos look incredible.",

    "selftext": "The title is a bit dramatic but I'm having a hard time getting over some things that happened to me this summer. For context, I travelled around lots of Europe for almost 3 months and returned back to my home in Canada two months ago. Most of the trip was great, some ups and downs, I wasn't feeling all the best all the time but for the majority of it I was having a blast. I think being solo for almost all of it made me confront a lot of my inner thoughts and feelings, so trying to navigate that while changing my setting a lot caused a rollercoaster of emotions.\n\nBut beyond the typical wonder of travel and exploring, I ended up having a short romance with someone on my trip (a local) and I didn't want to leave. This was near the end of my trip, so I already had my plane ticket home and things booked, plus the expiration date on my visa. But in a perfect world void of any commitments or responsibilities, I would have stayed to see how things developed. Granted, this was only a week long romance and I understand that I was in exceptional circumstances while travelling with the whole rose-coloured glasses and what not. But I haven't been able to shake my experience with this person and it has been over two months since I left their city.\n\nBeing home now, I'm feeling like my life is so dull. This big trip was supposed to be something I did after I graduated university to get a bit of travel under my belt before starting a career full time. Now that I'm starting my career I just feel dread that I'm starting to work towards a life here while I feel a pull to head back Europe to live at least for a bit. I think the fact that I travelled solo for such a long time altered my brain a bit. Like if the trip was shorter, I could feel like it was a vacation, but the way that I extended it so long made me develop feelings of staying.\n\nEven if this person moves on, it's the fact that I felt like I found a place for me to flourish and be myself overseas which is something I lack at home. I had planned to wait things out and allow myself to move on but for months now I've just been in a weird state of mind where I feel sad and directionless and want to take steps towards an internship or something overseas to live there even for a little bit. I feel kind of delusional but I can't shake some feelings I have and just want to just hear from other people that may have experienced something similar. Has anyone else had a similar experience or advice for getting through these feelings?",

      "Sure, travel does 'change your brain' in a way...it changes your mentality, your outlook on life,in many cases.You learn and you grow.\n\nNothing really unusual there!\n\nWhat to do? No reason why you can't start looking at your options.There are many ways of living abroad temporarily, working abroad or just traveling more in the future.\n\nYou need to try and be realistic too.. living anywhere also has downsides, and it's easy to remember only the positives about a place.Same thing for holiday romance I guess ;-)\n\nHave you contacted this person since you went home? How did they react?",
      "Having had a very similar experience, I have some good insights for you. \n\nThis was over a year ago. Solo traveled Europe for 3 months. About half way through the trip, I met a girl who was also traveling. We hit it off, and ended up traveling a bit together for like a week. In that brief time, I felt the most love and connection I\u2019ve ever felt for anyone. When this was happening, she was at the end of her trip and had to return home (on the other side of the world from where I lived). She seemed to accept what I didn\u2019t want to: it was never going to work. And she was right. You simply cannot and should not move to the other side of the world to be with someone you just met. When she left, I felt the emptiest I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. I was so heartbroken. If she randomly popped into my mind, my heart would hurt so badly that it was like having the wind suddenly knocked out of me, and I\u2019d need to literally sit down. That lasted for about 6-7 months after returning home.\nI\u2019ve since moved on. I think about her now and then but it doesn\u2019t hurt as much. Im even in a long term relationship now and still don\u2019t feel the same way with my current partner like the way I felt with her in that one week. Sounds messed up, I know. But here\u2019s why we feel this way:\n\nIn the context of travel, especially solo travel, we tend to romanticize things. You meet strangers in hostels who end up feeling like your closest friends for just two days only for you to never see them again, maybe keep in touch on instagram. Everything you see and do is new and exciting and thought provoking and meaningful. The places you go and the people you meet. The same thing can happen on a romantic level. And what easier thing to romanticize than a LITERAL ROMANCE? Lol. It\u2019s just the state of your brain fueled by the context and side effects of solo adventure.\n\nThe thing you need to realize is this: You aren\u2019t actually in love with them. You\u2019re in love with the idea of them.\n\nAlso, another solo traveler told me this when i was pouring my heart out about her. He said that he considered me lucky, as most people go through their entire lives without an experience like that. It hurts now, but life gave you something beautiful, albeit brief, and that\u2019s something to be grateful for.\n\nMaybe this will all help a little bit, as it did for me. But still, I feel for ya, because it all hurts just the same!",
      "I chased 2 travel romances that were both great adventures and I never regret it. I\u2019m still with my current girlfriend that I met while traveling two years ago and deciding to just stay when I met her.",
      "Even if you were to move to where you were traveling, you would still eventually have to work and live a more structured life (assuming you don\u2019t become a working nomad). \n\nDo you regret the romance? You knew that it would be short lived but went ahead anyways. As long as you were safe, I would try and enjoy the memories. If there is potential for a long distance relationship, it doesn\u2019t hurt to reach out. And if that\u2019s not the case, it still has helped you discover what you are looking for in a relationship. \n\nIt sounds like you had a wonderful experience that had a positive impact on your life.",
      "I travelled in Europe solo after I graduated too for a few months. Had romances and everything. Literally what you typed is how I felt to the T. I think it\u2019s a very common experience. The romance you will definitely get over. But your wanderlust no. It\u2019s been 7 years for me since then and I work FT but I travel probably 5-6 weeks a year. I\u2019m planning to quit my job and take at least a full year to travel. If I were 22 again I would have continued travelling so long as funds lasted. Anyway now I\u2019m 29 and have more funds after years of working to be able to do some serious long term travel. But I still have enjoyed so many trips since then. So in short the wanderlust won\u2019t go away, just take plenty of travel each year even if u go into your career right now",
      "Travel is such a great way to stretch your mind to possibilities. No matter what path you choose, in the long run there are no mistakes it is all a great  adventure. We cannot k choose safety Helen Keller said - Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature. Nor do the children of men experience it. avoiding danger is no safer in the long run as out right exposure.",

      "Been solo travelling for 10 years, left Canada almost 7 years ago and been in Australia since. Best decision ever, although I\u2019m currently planning on going home for Christmas and relocated in Australia afterwards (still no idea where) I do not see myself living back home. In some ways it feels backwards to move back to Canada, all my friend have house and family, depts and responsibilities that make sure they can\u2019t just up and go. My advice is to follow your heart while you don\u2019t have obstacles to hold you down, you can always go back to home if things don\u2019t work out. Buy that one way ticket, and have fun. Maybe that romance was only meant to show you an another side of what\u2019s possible for you. Doesn\u2019t mean you meant to be with them, but it might have been the perfect person to change your path \ud83d\udc95\u2728",
      "I honestly had to check your post history to make sure this wasnt written by the person I had a summer romance with. Its so similar to my summer, and I sympathise with your home life, I feel the same.\n\n  \nI went travelling around Europe for a few weeks back in March, met an Ozzy girl in Milan and we spent a few days together, then we decided to travel to Venice together afterwards. Once our week was over, I went back home for a couple months, but kept chatting and eventually I flew back out to hang out with her in the summer, we ended up going to Albania, Croatia, Slovenia, Vienna, Bratislava and all over the UK. She came to my hometown, met my mum and everything. \n\nBut once Summer was over, she went back to Oz and we both miss each other so much. We went from having the best times of our lives, to being a world apart and it sucks. I've had crippling holiday blues since I got back, and I realize how shit my home life is. I'm actually considering if I should just jack my life in and move to Aus to be with her. \n\nBut yeah, travelling is great when you're doing it, but it lets you know how good life can be, and how going back to the 9-5 is a suffocating rat race.",
      "A bit late, but it\u2019s funny how deeply relate to this sentiment yet at a very different point in my life, down to the vacation romance and feeling directionless upon returning home.\u00a0\n\nFor context, I\u2019m in my early 30\u2019s and also recently got back from a longer vacation. Not quite 3 months, but still long enough to get away from the mundanity of day to day life. I have the privilege of working fully remote, but am limited to the US due to data privacy restrictions. Throughout my trip I came across a lot of digital nomads who work from different countries with or without their employers knowledge or contractors and while that lifestyle has it\u2019s pros and cons, it allowed me to envision a reality where I\u2019m not restricted to the same city I\u2019ve been living my whole life. So while it was nice coming back home to the community I\u2019ve built and place that I DO love to live, I also felt an overwhelming sense of ennui and meaninglessness upon my return. Like there was no point to anything I was doing. And I think that feeling was just further exasperated by a brief but meaningful connection I made while abroad. I\u2019ve been frustrated with the dating scene back home, and while I understand that I do not know this person like that, I completely understand the sentiment of mourning the very real connections that could be made, be it not for the distance.\n\nWhat has helped me, since then, is channeling that energy into changing my circumstances. I\u2019ve accepted that nothing will change unless I start to put the time and effort into making that happen. You\u2019re still young, and there are plenty of opportunities offered through employers and programs abroad. The one thing I\u2019d just suggest is to reflect upon and be very honest regarding your underlying motivations behind this. Because if it comes down this person you\u2019ve met, or the possibility of romance elsewhere, you have to be prepared for the reality of it not working out- or experiencing the same or different frustrations that you have back home. But if you\u2019re truly in it for the new experiences, good and bad then I\u2019d start taking the steps in the direction where you'd like to see yourself in the future.",
      "I can 100% relate, it happened to me this year (including an unexpected romance before my trip ended). Idk how to feel about Canada anymore after seeing how I can flourish in another country. For me, I'm preparing myself to leave Canada tbh and aim for a nomad lifestyle hopefully next year.",
      "See what countries allow a work visa for people under 30. I wouldn't put much into the romance that you had because speaking from experience they are just fast flings of passion, something to be remembered, but it's just a moment in time.",
      "A good reason to work smart and make money.  I\u2019m on my third long trip, currently 2 months into another 8 month trip around the world.  \n\nChalk the romance up to a positive travel experience that will perpetually stay on the what if category.  A similar story girl I knew from Prague, 25 years ago, popped into my head as I was walking around Rome, I smiled thought \u201cwhat if/should I have\u2026\u201d. Looked to my right then my left before deciding what/where/who to explore next.\n\nNext!",
      "I understand you 100%. I was 33 when I started traveling and 37 when I had my first travel romance. 17 years later and I\u2019m 50 now and travel six weeks of the year in annual holidays. Back in 2015 I took a sabbatical from work and travelled for a year around the world. Next year I\u2019m doing a second sabbatical traveling Europe and Africa (Oslo to Cape Town). \n\nThe travel romance may fade or change but the desire to travel never does. You seem to be young and have your life ahead of you. Why not consider a working holiday visa or work away/volunteering? Consider becoming a digital nomad or an influencer? If you can consider getting a certificate like diving, surfing or TEFOL (teaching English) to work on the road? \n\nTo answer your question: i recommend to young people to never stop traveling.",
      "Long term solo travel fundamentally changed me, my relationship with myself, and how I connect with the world.  \n\nI expected going home to be hard, but the longer term shift in my values and my ability to connect with others took me by surprise.  Going home after that never felt like home again, and there\u2019s been aspects of the change in myself that have been really hard, but I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. Those solo travel and living overseas experiences are part of who I am, and they\u2019re the parts I\u2019m most proud of. \n\nRomance or not, if you want to go live in Europe for a while, absolutely go do it.",
      "Start planning to actually move. Just do it. Look at all the possible things you could do there and have a think about whether or not you would feel the same about wanting to move there even if the short romance never became a long romance. During the process of putting your plan into action, the universe will either keep putting obstacles in front of you (which you either remove or not) or strangely, everything will align so that you\u2019re offered a job there, you happen to find out you know someone else in the city, etc, aka other things start pulling you towards the place. Soon, because you know you\u2019re going, your gut will tell you whether it\u2019s the right thing or not. \nAnd you know what, if you pack up your shit and go, it IS the right thing. The thing you end up doing IS the right thing. Whether or not that person ends up being \u201cyour person\u201d or not. \nHow boring would life be if nothing ever pulled you anywhere.",

      "I can relate big time. I started traveling at 27 or so after grad school. I had an insanely good time with romances, adventure, new friends, etc. I then started my career in a big US city and always kind of felt that pull back to travel. Well I became a digital nomad a few years ago and now I am 40, single, and still just traveling. I am not even sure I enjoy it that much but it is just so much better than the life at home. I guess what I am saying is that sure, travel is fun, but it\u2019s not real in a way and it makes it so hard to build a life somewhere where you feel like you belong. I am probably overreacting but after a decade and a half of amazing travel, dozens of romances, etc. I fear that I may actually just end up alone, never sure where to plant my flag and never invested enough in someone or somewhere to stay too long. There are pluses and minuses to everything, but you won\u2019t be happy unless you can appreciate what is right in front of you. Godspeed!",
      "I had almost the exact same experience.  After returning to the US, I eventually ended up finding a job and moving back there (Poland) where I stayed for almost seven years. What\u2019s my perspective now? It\u2019s surprisingly hard to say\u2026. I was initially obsessed with my experiences there. It was such a strong draw to go back and deepen those experiences. Yes, there was a romantic connection as well. I\u2019m now about 20 years removed from that first \u201cawakening\u201d and pull towards that path. Looking back at it all, I have very few regrets in making that decision. In those 7 years, I have a lifetime of experiences thanks to the time I spent there. But as is generally true with life, I recognize that it did come at a cost. What cost? Well, now more than a decade after being back, I \u201conly\u201d have experiences, experiences that fade with every year being removed from that period life. A part of me wonders if in my limited years on earth if my energies would have been better invested, less in transient experience, and more in living intentionally with family and in relationships that are more permanent. Some of my closest friendships are from those days, but after visiting recently and reconnecting I realized that these people were probably inhabiting a different space in my heart than perhaps I had in theirs, simply because they were intertwined with so much of this experiential part of my life. For them I think I was more of the interesting foreigner that they were great friends with for a time. One thing I did end up realizing is, no matter how long you are there, and how much you assimilate, you are never quite at home. I felt this despite the fact I had never lived in one city continuously longer than I had there. The only thing I would offer as some sort of advice, is to live intentionally if you do go. It\u2019s easy to get swept away with the newness and adventure of everything. I mean honestly that\u2019s half the point. But before you know it your 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s will be behind you. Just make sure you get everything out of those years you can, but not at the expense of the rest of your life. I probably would change very few things with how that chapter of my life unfolded, but also now realize I probably missed out on other opportunities. That\u2019s just me though. But I do know, having had many conversations with others contemplating what you are, that this is a very common \u201creaction\u201d to your first experience of seeing the world opened up. Especially so if there its romance involved, and there usually is. Either way, if you do it right, you can\u2019t go wrong. Good luck!",
      "Oh wow, you just summed up everything I went through! I just got back to England after spending a month in Thailand where I had a three-week romance with someone who lives there. Now I want to move to Asia, though not because of them, but still!\n\nMy advice would be to plan carefully and go for it if that\u2019s what your heart is telling you to do. Just make sure to prepare properly and focus your energy on the move while still enjoying the things that make you happy in Canada, like friends, hobbies, or your community. Meditation has really helped me appreciate my surroundings more (I had to adjust after returning to England, where it was raining every day after being in a tropical climate!). It\u2019s much better for your mental health that way.\n\nI\u2019m now getting ready to move to Thailand, so I\u2019m working on two certifications to help me find a job there. Having a concrete plan like this has really made the process easier for me.\n\nIn the meantime, sending positive thoughts to you!",
      "I\u2019m going through this in my 40s. I was prepared to make the leap and move to southern Europe this fall, but then had a health issue to take care of, so plans are postponed for a year. However, I still feel the pull, maybe even more so because indeed, we only live once! I feel that at any age dreams should be pursued.\n\nRegarding the romance, I had that happen to me too, and after talking a bunch to that person it started to feel like maybe they wouldn\u2019t be a great match for me. I went through a time of recovering from that heartache and trying to distance my love of Europe from this person I chanced upon meeting. However, at the end of the day I know it\u2019s my excitement for moving abroad that matters most, and even if I had done it because of a \u201cdoomed\u201d relationship, even that\u2019s not a waste because id still be learning about myself along the way! You could have a spark with someone as nowhere and discover a relationship won\u2019t work out\u2026and you\u2019ll be ok regardless. Follow your heart, your path, and don\u2019t worry about the \u201cproper\u201d career path. If you can figure out your visa options and afford to live, you\u2019ll figure it out and can always come back if you need/want to. You\u2019re not locked in, and the more we flex this thinking at any age, the happier we\u2019re bound to feel. Good luck to you!",
      "solo travelling allowed you to experience a plethora of new things, and then on top of that you got to experience very early stage romance with someone you clearly rlly liked while travelling.\n\nI think you need to spice up life at home!",
      "Are you still in regular contact with your vaction romance person?  That will pull at you.\n\nAnd you have post trip blues.\n\nYes, I have suffered from all of these and more but I started later in my life than you have done.  Had I started younger, I would have been very poor most of my life, rather than living a full and exciting life growing my career and social life in Canada, becoming a homeowner, being able to afford regular vacations out of the country and eventually, spending long periods of time traveling.\n\nGive yourself something to look forward to, build towards.  Plan a trip in a year, either back to see your romance person or elsewhere (Machu Picchu perhaps). Focus on your career for this one year, go to the gym, socialize with friends regularly, go to theatre, art shows, sporting events, festivals, etc.  \n\nThis is the time to build your career and your life at home in Canada, which can be incredibly rich if you let it unfold for you as it should. You'll get out of it what you put into it. \n\nAnd then suddenly that year will have passed and it will be time for your planned vacation.\n\nIn the short term, call some friends and make some social dates!  Get out of your head so much."

However, some countries are known for being easier or harder to be able to chat up with locals. This can be through people you meet spontaneously, service workers, and anyone in between.\n\n**Based on my experience, the easiest to getting to chat with locals are:**\n\n\\- Ireland/Scotland: I found the Irish and Scottish to be very outgoing with some cab drivers having comedian-level humour and the pub culture makes it very easy to chat with new people\n\n\\- United States: Despite what you might hear about the US in the news, Americans are genuinely some of the most outgoing and friendly people I've met both within the USA and abroad. American culture is extraverted by nature so it's very easy to randomly chat with people and have them speak to you like they've been your buddy for many years\n\n\\- Mexico: Like their American neighbours, I found Mexicans to be some of the most warm, hospitable and outgoing people I've come across. This is especially true once you go to more \"local\" parts of Mexico that aren't just beach resorts as Mexicans always seemed to want to know more about me\n\n\\- Mediterranean Europe: Countries like Spain, Portugal, Greece, Croatia, and Italy all have very warm and friendly locals I find. Idk if the warm sunny weather helps their mood, but I just found the people to be very easy to talk to even if they don't know much English and they want to make sure you are enjoying their country to the fullest\n\n\\- Brazil: I'm cheating a bit here because I've never been to Brazil but I've only come across easy-going Brazilians everywhere I've met them at. Based on my experience, if you want to have a good time just go where the Brazilians are at lol\n\n**The hardest to getting to chat with locals are:**\n\n\\- The Nordics: I found people in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway to be very reserved and closed off. Scandinavians are very polite and their society is extremely well organized but I can see why so many expats and immigrants are struggling to meet local people.\n\n\\- Japan: I know there's a language barrier since I don't speak any Japanese and most Japanese people don't speak much English, but while known for being very polite, Japanese people are among the most introverted I've met as it's completely normal for local people to do everything but yourself including shopping, eating, etc.\n\n\\- The Alpine region: The Swiss, Austrians and Bavarians are truly people of few emotions and words. While I was able to meet many friends who were fellow tourists during my trips to alps, I had exactly zero full conversations with local people in Switzerland, Austria, and Bavarian Germany.\n\nWhat would your experiences be on this?",

And not easy to get around without a car? \n\nBased on the above, I think I could do budget-style travelling (hostels, cook my own food etc.) in Switzerland and make it work. My questions are: \n\n1. Is < $100USD a day in Switzerland managable (including accommodation, food and transport)\n2. Will Norway and the Balkans be difficult to get around with public transport only? \n3. Will the Balkans be too hot for hiking in July/August? \n4.

      "I just got back from slovenia with beautiful nature and nice hikes. I was really safe and people were amazing. 2 things though, public transport wasn't great and there is a small risk of TBE there (there's a vaccine though).",
      "I think a very underrated country for solo travel, particular solo hiking is Germany. The German Alps are quite busy during the summer but across the more central parts of the country are more moderate mountain ranges which, whilst not as stunning, are very quaint and you\u2019ll have them mostly to yourself. Examples are the Palatine Forest, the Thuringian Forest and the Bavarian/Bohemian Forest on the border with the Czech Republic. Trails are well-marked and well-maintained everywhere I\u2019ve been in Germany. I can\u2019t advise on accommodation because I was staying in a tent but Germany has lots of youth hostels which are more affordable, although a lot of them are strictly for under 18s only. Food is both affordable and good quality in Germany if you shop at discount supermarkets (Lidl, Aldi, Netto). Last summer when I did a lot of solo hiking in Germany there was a \u20ac9 a month ticket that granted you access to all short distance regional public transport in the country for a month for just \u20ac9, and you don\u2019t need to be a citizen to buy it, so if it\u2019s still on offer this summer definitely go for it as you can get basically anywhere in the country on trains and busses.\n\nAustria has mountain scenery on par with Switzerland but a little cheaper and more accommodating for backpackers. There are a couple hostels located in the mountains from which you can do day hikes, on my second ever solo trip I stayed in one in Bad Gastein and hiked to the Pfalnersee, and another in Gr\u00fcnau im Almtal and hiked to Kasberg peak, both great hikes. On my second trip through Austria I had a tent but if you can find cheap places to stay near the Totes Gebirge subrange then there are some beautiful hikes in that area and it\u2019s a far less crowded nearby alternative to more famous Dachstein subrange which gets very busy in the summer.\n\nThe UK also has quaint underrated nature and a great network of youth hostels under the YHA along with abundant, well-marked trails all over the country. For better nature and friendlier people I recommend the Celtic fringe, so Scotland, Wales and the West Country as well as the Lake District. Public transport however is expensive and unreliable.\n\nThe Balkans I highly recommend. Some of the areas with the best nature such as Slovenia and the Croatian coast are barely cheaper than Western Europe but if you go to countries like Bosnia, Albania and Macedonia you can enjoy very cheap accommodation and transportation (food is generally expensive relative to everything else in the Balkans however, although the local cuisine is definitely worth trying). The mountains here are generally tougher and the trails are fewer and poorer in quality, and yes the region will be warmer, but there are still plenty of good day hikes in these countries. In Bosnia for instance I recommend the area near the border with Montenegro around the country\u2019s highest mountain, Magli\u0107. Bears, wolves, wild boar, etc\u2026do exist in the Dinaric Alps (the main mountain range that runs through ex-Yugoslavia and Albania) but they are not a real hazard, in all my time solo hiking in this region I\u2019ve only seen a bear once and it just ran away upon seeing me (which they do most of the time) whereas wolf attacks on humans are virtually unheard of in Europe. I generally found the wild boar in the region to be small and skittish and never felt threatened by them either. The Via Dinarica is a set of long distance trails that pass through the best that these mountains have to offer, and you can turn various stretches into day hikes, just bear in mind that the more remote/less well known stretches are poorly marked/maintained. At every stage of the trail there are mountain huts to stay in for a small fee. Whilst the Balkans have a reputation for being violent, nowadays they have very low crime rates (Slovenia for instance is one of the safest countries in the world) and people will be generally friendlier than in other parts of Europe, particularly in Albania (I heavily recommend the \u201cAccursed mountains\u201d on the border with Montenegro for some of the most incredible mountain scenery in Europe). The only Balkan country I sometimes felt unsafe in and might reconsider revisiting if I were a woman was Bulgaria, although the southwest of the country with the famous Rila and Pirin mountain ranges is safe. Communication will be an issue however unless you learn some of the local langauge and the public transport networks in these countries are fairly poor. \n\nFeel free to dm me if you want more info as I have a lot of experience solo hiking in Europe.",
      "Switzerland is incredible but that budget would be tough to maintain - I think you could maybe get down to around $50 a night for accomodation, but the trains are really not cheap (you can book far in advance and hope for the best), so the second you need to move between cities it gets difficult.\n\n*That being said* I did enjoy my time in Lucerne/Luzern, I stayed at Backpackers Luzern and did some short hikes that were lovely. \n\nAs you use USD, I'll assume you're flying in from the US and also say I went to Iceland last July and it was great (and you might save on airfare to free up budget). Food is a *huge* cost, but I found the buses to be very reasonable and I don't think I paid too much for my accomodation either. I recommend doing the hike at Hveragerdi hot springs! The nature in Iceland is truly something else.",

My life is back to routine after being at home for a couple weeks and I\u2019ve started a new job working full time in an office. \n\nThe only thing that hasn\u2019t changed is how we feel.

There\u2019s a possibility that she may visit me in New Zealand come two months time. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m struggling to reconcile with the change in our relationship. We don\u2019t want to put labels on it, and she doesn\u2019t want to be fully exclusive during this time. It\u2019s difficult because when I finish work, it\u2019s night time and she\u2019s out partying or hanging out with people. Before I left New Zealand, I hadn\u2019t been in a relationship for years. \n\nAs much as I cherish this girl and our connection, this is all new to me and bringing out some feelings of insecurity. I want to give this a chance, but I\u2019m not fully comfortable with being in an effectively open relationship. She wants to be able to make out with people, but not have sex. Her view is that making out is purely platonic or based on physical attraction alone and does not detract from our deeper emotional connection. I disagree and think it\u2019s all a gray area. My attraction to her means I don\u2019t want to hook up with anybody else.\n\nI think she deserves to enjoy her travels while being single, but I feel as though this arrangement doesn\u2019t work for me because I struggle to trust and don\u2019t like the idea of someone else getting intimate with her. I feel like calling it all off because this could be a deal-breaker, even though it would ruin any chance of us being together romantically. \n\nDoes anyone have any guidance?",

She finally realized that the relationship was a great memory but reality wasn't what she wanted.\n\nTravel romances are wonderful and dreamy and not based in reality for most of the time because you aren't doing the 9-5 daily life thing.

      "I would have 20-30 long-distance boyfriends if I approached my travels in the same way.  \n\nWhen you're on trip there is a strange warping of time and space that turns fairly mundane summer flings into a lifelong romance.  The same thing happens with even the briefest of friendships.  Suddenly you are promising relative strangers that they can stay in your mothers house for 3 months next summer. \n\nYou simply have unrealistic expectations and equally unrealistic demands for someone you have just met.  No need to make a whole scene full of ultimatums and empty promises.  Just tell her to have a good time and keep up casual connection (once a month at most).  If you are able to see each other again, great, don't put your life on hold for it though.",

I have this weird thing with hopeless nearly impossible romance.  The second time in my life I\u2019ve done the long distance thing.\n\nThis second time around, it was more of a possibility for me.  I\u2019m more established, can afford it, so it just seemed easy logistically.  It just didn\u2019t work out romantically.\n\nWhatever you do, give it a try.

      "Hi! I'm a European woman and I went to Kerala recently for a month. I loved it!!! \nOut of the places you're planning to go to, we went to Kochi, Vagamon and Varkala. \n- Kochi is great, it's best to stay in Fort Kochi for touristic things, you'll be able to walk most places. That said, if you're not into cities in general, you can definitely skip it. There's so many other places to go to enjoy nature.\n- Vagamon was my favourite place we went to. It's so beautiful! The views are amazing. I recommend the windy walk hike if you have time: the views are supposed to be great. We couldn't see anything though as the weather was too bad haha. (There's also a few places where you can do paragliding if you're into that). I know you already have accommodations booked but if anything changes, we stayed at Little Flowers Farm and it's amazing!\n- Varkala: the cliff beaches are very beautiful. But we couldn't swim in the sea, it's too rough. We went during monsoon season, so maybe during summer it's possible? There's also a few bars in Varkala that sell alcohol, which is very appreciated in Kerala \ud83d\ude07. Overall it's a nice town.\n- you also mention Athirappilly falls. They're beautiful, but I'm not sure it's worth going if you have very little time. I liked the hikes in the area more than seeing the actual falls personally!\n\nI can't help regarding public transport as we drove everywhere but never underestimate the travel time, even for small distances. It takes ages to go from A to B, even on the highways. And a big part of the main highway in Kerala is being redone currently, it is making traffic even worse \ud83e\udee0. If you're planning to use the train, I think it's best to book in advance (like at least a week in advance) if you want to have an assigned seat.\n\nRegarding food: honestly I ate everything but meat and had street food everywhere and my bf and I never got sick at all! That said, make sure you drink bottled water and it's probably best to avoid uncooked vegetables if the place doesn't seem super clean... The food is delicious, especially breakfast food \ud83e\udd70.\n\nIf you have specific questions don't hesitate to ask, I can ask my bf hehe!\n\nHave a great trip!",
      "Hey, welcome to Kerala. You\u2019ve made the right choice by visiting South India given that you want to avoid the crowds. \n\nJust want you to take into consideration that although places might appear close distance-wise, the combination of traffic and some dodgy roads make it a longer trip than you\u2019re expecting. You wouldn\u2019t really enjoy Athirapilly waterfalls if it\u2019s something you want to stop by on the way. You\u2019ll need to allow some time to soak in and enjoy the views. There\u2019s Vazhachaal as well a bit further down the road that used to be a recommended spot, but I haven\u2019t been there in more than a decade. \n\nWhat\u2019s on your shortlist for the visit and what are you intending to achieve out of this trip? Is it a relaxing holiday or do you just want to see places? Are you renting a car?"

      "Costa Rica is absolutely _stunning_, felt like being in a fairytale to be honest. No other place I\u2019ve been to yet can compare to it in terms of nature.

I\u2019ve also been to Madeira which somewhat reminded me of CR, but basically without any fauna. I just spent about a month in Kerala and found it to be different from both places. If I were you, I\u2019d probably go to Cambodia, Indonesia, Bhutan or Vietnam. Nicaragua is also amazing and very cheap (I absolutely loved it there), otherwise Peru or Colombia could also be nice options for you."

Did some initial research and created a very general rough draft of where to hit based on my interests: by FAR the biggest interest is nature and scenery. Not a huge fan of temples, history, or beach activities so my sample itinerary centers around this accordingly. Also love food as most people do.\n\nAlso just based on some research, I plan on skipping some famous places because either they\u2019re underwhelming or just don\u2019t fit my interest but do let me know if I am missing out!\n\n**Sri Lanka**\n\nArrive in Colombo (looking like it\u2019ll be at night most likely). Next day, head over to Sigiriya. Stay for a day or so, not missing the Lion Head of course along with a few more scenic views. I heard Mihintale might be worth it but don\u2019t see too much reviews on this.\n\nSkipping Kandy (not my cup of tea + I heard it\u2019s underwhelming) and instead go straight to Nuwara Eliya. Stay for two days roughly and maybe do a quick excursion to Ella but probably not going to stay overnight and continue onto Yala.\n\nSpend a day or two at Yala for the safari and then head over to Galle. Mirissa I heard is the most famous beach spot in SL but like I said, not a huge ocean activities fan so probably going to skip it. Galle is also a beach town but I do want to visit at least one and I heard even without the ocean activities, it\u2019s a worthwhile place to stay.\n\nAfter two days, head back to Colombo and fly over to Thiruvananthapuram to start the Kerala leg of the journey. \n\n**Kerala**\n\nHead straight to Varkala to just kinda relax and give myself a breather for two days. Heard the aquarium is good? But mostly staying to walk along the cliffs and relax.\n\nThen I plan on heading over to Alappuzha to enjoy the backwaters and houseboats. I don\u2019t want to stay overnight on them which I heard isn\u2019t that worth anyways and also skipping Thekkady as I see that town also mentioned as not a must-see. For me, I think I only need a full day here.\n\nThe long part of the journey is probably going from here to Munnar to visit the hills and more nature. Will stay for another two days to explore. Gardens, waterfalls, hills, food, definitely looking to be the highlight for my Kerala trip!\n\nFinally, will head to Kochi for a day to see Fort Kochi and other nearby attractions then head home.\n\nSo some questions I have include:\n\n- For transportation, I heard SL it\u2019s recommended to hire a personal driver for the whole duration? I know trains are a thing but my itinerary probably doesn\u2019t find that ideal. Any good websites to hire one? \n\n- Likewise for Kerala, I heard busses are the way to go for the most part but trains are also good for the coastal cities? I\u2019m having issues finding timetables though. Any help would be awesome!\n\n- Anyone who\u2019s visited these places have any other recommendations that might appeal to me that I haven\u2019t listed here?\n\nThanks!",

Just to give you an idea: on our last day on the island we no longer had the car and we decided to take the bus to Sao Louren\u00e7o because we wanted to visit again. The 30 min drive on the car turned into an almost 2 hour ride on the bus. The bus back to Funchal was 30 minutes late, and we had to wait in the dark for it to arrive. We weren't even sure it was coming. \n\nRenting a car is inexpensive (for us it was 30\u20ac/day with full insurance, manual cars were even cheaper but given how steep and winding the roads are, I would recommend against it. Big cities like Funchal can be a bit chaotic with cars parked everywhere, but honestly it wasn't that bad. Just drive safely and abide to traffic laws. \n\n**Regarding Levadas/hiking routes**: you have to pay a 3\u20ac fee to walk them or you risk getting fined. Make sure you do so before leaving for the actual hike as often there's no signal up in the mountains. Also, pay attention to the weather report as conditions change rapidly and vary a lot from one part of the island to another and it can be very unpredictable. \n\nDon't try to squeeze too much stuff into your itinerary. Madeira is the kind of place where you'll want to relax and take in the views. ",

      "Thanks for this post! One of my biggest travel dreams is a road trip through the former USSR, or just through Russia (depending if borders with for example Belarus, Ukraine and Armenia are open). Such a diverse and fascinating country, and with such a rich history.\n\nI have a strange fascination for the Russian arctic. I have always been fascinated by the arctic (which, to keep things easy, could be defined as everything above the arctic circle). But while the far north of Scandinavia is developed and touristic, the arctic coast of Russia is wild nature with just a few small very isolated villages now and then. How people survive in such remote places and with such harsh weather, fascinates me a lot. I would love to visit places such as Teriberka, Dikson, Tiksi, Belushya Guba (on Novaya Zemlya islands), ... but there is a lot of paperworks needed for some of them, and due to remoteness even the unrestricted villages in the Russian arctic are hard to reach and expensive. But then this adds to the fascination somehow.\n\nI hope to be able to travel through Russia and explore it beyond the touristic hotspots like Moscow and St Petersburg. I don't have a car, so unless I'd hike with another person fascinated by Russia, it will be train and other local public transportation.",

      "Perth, Australia. I flew in for my cousin's wedding. I was 21 years old. The rehearsal dinner was on the beach. Afterwards I went for a walk and this surfer dude who was tan and blonde just kind of walked up and started talking to me. We basically sat on the beach till late and my family was yelling for me. A couple of days after the wedding I was on that same beach with my family and that guy came walking up. He asked if I wanted to go for a walk and we did. We sort of spent my last two days there in his little apartment. I had never really done anything like that before. I was young and stupid. It was like a week-long romance. After going back to the US I did talk to him a lot but after a while it cooled off. I wish I could have gone back but I didn't have the money and I was in college at the time. I still shake my head and think to myself \"I can't believe I did that!\"",

We just exploded Stockholm at night & talked about travel experiences and still keep up occasionally to this day on social media! Not real romance but just a silly fake romance & a fun story",
      "I love reading this. Mine was magical. Paris 2007, i got there without having a place to stay. Ran into a group of musicians and actors in front of the Pompidou. I started talking to some who spoke English and then I saw this man (I\u2019m a woman.) i thought he was the most beautiful person I\u2019d ever seen and we made eye contact across a few people. He came up and spoke to me in French. I said I didn\u2019t speak it. He was a native Spanish speaker and went through a cycle of languages asking me if i spoke them until he got to Portuguese. I\u2019m American but also speak Portuguese, he spoke 6 languages but English was not one. I was so excited to have a common language. We stayed up all night talking and i went back to his place and had sex in the morning. We were inseparable for the month I was there. We would spend all day talking, he showed me the whole city. Tho i had been there twice before, it was a totally different version of Paris. We drank coffee and talked all day about all the ideas we had, and then would watch the sunset and then spend all night having mindblowing sex. When we parted ways at a train station I felt like my life was over. But I came back home, went on with life. Thought about him often. \n\nI often imagined it was only magical to me, it felt almost like just a dream. And then ten years later,  he found me on Facebook! we are both married with families now but he had learned English and I had learned Spanish so we could talk to each other in our native languages. He told me it was just as magical for him and he\u2019d also thought about it the whole decade since. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d have the same whirlwind romance now as we did then, and we are happy in our lives now. but we\u2019ve stayed in touch since and it\u2019s good to know it was actually real.\n\nEdited to add: a really weird coincidence!

Then we kissed and all that sweet stuff, but parted ways and were headed to different destinations, by some universal fate, we both caught each other at a coffee shop in KL after having last minute decided to change our destinations, neither one of us knew the other was in KL.

      "I have a few stories, including my own, that are not too unlike yours or others here. Another couple I met in Peru had met travelling in Asia and travelled for a few months together when I met them. He's from Australia and she's from the US. I met my now-boyfriend in Peru at the same time I met them. Luckily, I lived in NYC and he lived in Montreal, so the distance wasn't too bad. I live with him now, 4 years later, and that couple I mentioned just got married last month. Another couple I knew met when we were travelling in New Zealand. They happened to both be from the same area in London. They dated for a few years, and then split up, and she's engaged to someone else.\n\nThe reality is that it is like any other relationship - if anything, it takes more work to sustain if you have to do long distance, and the stories of these relationships working out are the outliers. It's easy to become attached and cling to the idea of this movie-like romance - and I say this as someone who took a chance on a gut feeling and wouldn't discourage people from taking those chances. That said, you don't know how the relationship would have turned out in the long term, and people may be very different while traveling than they are to live with. No relationship is a guarantee, even mine. The most you can do is cherish the memories you have with that person. \n\nMaybe you will cross paths again - maybe not. Being open to these sort of experiences and getting attached to people isn't a bad thing or something to avoid. But to make things work in the long run requires serious commitment, and unfortunately a certain amount of resources. Had I met some guy from Australia myself, there's no realistic way I ever could have made long distance work or moved there temporarily for a few years. The flights alone would have been crazy expensive, never mind the time difference. Sometimes practical reasons do get in the way and there's nothing we can do - even when they don't, it's not a guarantee. There are billions of people in the world, and it won't be the last time you feel that sort of connection with someone.",
      "Was on a wine tour of Argentina. \n\nMet a gorgeous Uruguayan girl, she taught me to tango and said the wine and beef was better in Uruguay, so I absconded with her to check it out. It was a whirlwind romance, but very passionate, and I loved the food, wine and personal tours I got of the country. We got caught in the rain, went to markets, danced on the streets, all that good stuff.\n\nAnyway, I leave, we lose contact for a couple of years. During Coronavirus lockdowns, I was fairly curious what the situation was like in Uruguay, so I reached out to her and noticed her whatsapp number wasn't working. I actually thought I'd been blocked. I looked her up on social media, and saw she was no longer living in Uruguay, but Australia. \n\nAs someone who lives in Australia, that was the best news of 2020. I slid into the DMs, we got chatting, she was travelling Australia with her boyfriend and lockdowns were putting a lot of pressure on their relationship. Not too long after, they broke up and I was able to reciprocate by showing her around my country and we were together for most of Covid.",
      "I fortunately have three. \n\nIstanbul, 2011. I was 23, traveling with friends, and relatively inexperienced both at travel and romance. He was a waiter at a bar near our hostel. He was Kurdish, tall with blue eyes, and I fell for him immediately, mostly because he seemed not to take himself as seriously as other Turkish men. I probably would have never gone through with it had it not been for the reassurance of an older Australian woman, Kim, our adopted mother for a night. And when he walked Kim back to her hotel at night because she was afraid of Istanbul's packs of street dogs, I knew. I spent most of my week in Istanbul with him, even helping out in the bar taking orders in English. He spoke nearly no English, and I spoke no Turkish, so our communication depended greatly on the unspoken. After a week I left for Barcelona and mourned my loss, and for months after, I deluded myself into thinking I'd somehow get back to Turkey to be with him. \n\nReykjavik, 2014. I was visiting Iceland for a week with a friend. We met two French guys at a pub one night. He was completely unpretentious, playful, shabby but cute. At Austurv\u00f6llur, he invented a story about the man whose statue is there. He was kind, I genuinely liked him. We met various times throughout the week and I had the best time with him. After we parted ways, I lamented the fact that love sometimes has to travel such far distances, but I also somehow learned to accept this.\n\nBerlin, 2016. I'd met him on Tinder in Spain, where I was living. He was Australian, traveling Europe for a year. Tall, attractive, quirky, intelligent. We spent a few days together in Spain and he went on his way, but a few weeks later he asked me to meet him somewhere. We chose Berlin, rented an Airbnb, and played house for a weekend. I let myself understand what a relationship with him could feel like while keeping its expiration date at the forefront of my mind. This time I was stronger, and was able to recognize that this thing was so beautiful because of its ephemerality. And to this day I've still never had a better Tinder date.",
      "Just let it go, man, like releasing a butterfly. Every story I've ever heard of someone that went chasing after their travel romance ended up badly. It will be different if you see her again where she lives, among her people. Sometimes you can't recapture that magic ever again.",
      "I feel for you. I\u2019m currently in Istanbul with a guy I met here when I passed through late last year before flying to Mexico. We spent an incredible week together here which felt like it was straight out of a movie and I hated the \u201cwhat if\u201d hanging over our situation, so I flew back to Istanbul and I\u2019ve been here since December.\n\nMy tourist visa is up next Sunday so I\u2019m bracing myself for a teary goodbye at the airport too, even though I\u2019m excited to get home to see loved ones. I don\u2019t really know what the future has in store for us but whatever happens, it\u2019s been a beautiful experience. Travel romances are a wild ride. Sending you good thoughts!",
      "My slutty girlfriend could probably talk about 20 of those travel romances lol",
      "My travel romance was on a rafting trip. I had a boyfriend at home but during high school I went on a 10-day whitewater rafting trip in the northern U.S. One of the fellows on the trip and I just clicked and spent a lot of time together. We had an immediate, emotional connection, but it was strictly a yearning, platonic thing since I was attached to someone else. On the final night of the trip, we lay in our separate sleeping bags next to each other and shared a kiss. He was a true gentleman. We saw each other a few times at gatherings but just in passing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. The boyfriend and I are now married. So I've always had a clean conscience about that trip!",
      "Not really romance, but definitely bizarre and something I was unsure how to deal with at the time. Back when I was new in sales, I was given the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin region because as the new guy, nobody wanted to go up there in the winter, so I was given the \"opportunity\". I was in Bemidji in February, and the hotel I was at had a nice indoor pool amd hot tub, with TVs, so I was chilling in the hot tub watching TV and this decent looking 40-ish woman dressed in professional business attire walks into the pool area, looks at me in the hot tub. and strips bare-assed naked, jumping into the hot tub with me. She said something along the lines of \"Hi, I'm Jennifer and I had a really long day!\" I was married at the time, completely caught off guard, and really not sure what to do.... so I sort of sat there slack-jawed and tried to make small talk. I decided she must be nuts, made some excuse, and hopped out of the tub returning to my room. (Just horny on the road never crossed my mind at the time... a complete stranger so blatant?)\n\nThis was a couple of ex-wives ago, and I knew that crazy chick sex was usually pretty good (ex wife number one was batshit nuts), but the randomness of it all sort of freaked me out.",
      "The only romances I have are travel romances unfortunately. And they always end",
      "One sided romance: I was visiting Vienna and went to the same coffee shop each morning. So did this mid-20's looking woman with wavy dark blonde hair and green eyes. I was smitten hard. She was there literally every morning I was. We locked eyes a couple times but looked away when we did. \n\nI had maybe three days left in my trip and that morning I walked past her table but she was on her phone. She was speaking English! After grabbing my drink I sat down and began getting up the courage to talk to her. Didn't do it that day, or the next.\n\nMy last full day in Vienna I went to the shop, she was there. I finally got up the courage, walked over, and asked if she spoke English. She smiled, said yes! in a friendly tone. I asked to sit and we talked for the rest of the morning. I swear I was in love.\n\nLunchtime came and I knew I had to get to the airport. I asked her for a way to contact her. She gave me a piece of paper with her WhatsApp number. We parted ways and I was ecstatic.\n\nShe never responded to my messages after that. I still don't know why. \n\nHer name was Sarah. I still think about her occasionally.",
      "dubai, UAE. one side romance but i asked a random guy for tourist help. i couldnt find my hotel so i needed someone to guide me. when we got to the hotel he relized that the hotel was also the hotel he was at. we were actually next to eachother. so we become friends. since he lived there he told me about turist places to visit and then i would go on my way. i thought he was just a nice guy helping a turist out. but in my last day, he decided to show me an album of some pics he had of me from one day when i waited for my mom to come back and we tried some tiktok filters. and then after he showed me that he went on one knee and propose? i am still shocked a bit about it. i told him i dont see him as more then a friend and i think he understood at one point."

    "selftext": "Booked a three day jungle trip from Iquitos, Peru. Within the first few hours, thanks to the extremely negligent (bordering on the reckless) decisions of the company and guide (edit: see company name below), we were completely lost deep in the Amazon jungle with no food, water or any safety supplies. Guide had collapsed from exhaustion and lay down to die, refusing to get up. Rescue was nothing short of a miracle. Full story is below - Any thoughts on how to make the company take some sort of responsibility are appreciated.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother (21M) and I (27F) have always wanted to do a trip into the jungle, so planned an entire itinerary in Peru around doing so. We looked at a few different online tours, and booked a two-night tour leaving from Iquitos and going into the Amazon. The tour was one of the less luxurious options but had very good reviews so we felt it was a safe choice. We spent the days leading up to it in Lima procuring and stocking our day packs with safety supplies (correct clothing and gear, strong insect repellent, flashlights, medicines) and researching how to be safe. We were worried about lethal snake or spider bites, jaguars, caimans, mosquito-borne diseases etc, but the golden rule from all of the advice online was to always trust and follow your guide and you\u2019ll be safe, as they know the jungle and will always cut a safe path for you and point out dangers. Thousands of people do Amazon tours every year and have a great time. We were really excited.\n\nOn the day the trip was starting, we met at the office in Iquitos and then took a boat for about an hour and a half down the Amazon river. The small group doing our tour included our guide (Peruvian \\~35M but seemed to speak good English), a young girl who seemed to serve no purpose except to accompany him, and a mother and daughter (\\~55F and 30F), the latter of which spoke fluent English and Spanish.\n\nThe boat made a couple of five minute stops along the way, firstly to get some gas and then to let some other guests off. It stopped a third time at about 11am and our guide motioned for us to get off. We thought we must be starting the tour so picked up our bags, but he told us to leave our bags on the boat. We assumed this was just another five minute stop. We asked if we needed our gumboots, and he said no.\n\nWe follow him off the boat. When we get up the river bank, he looks at our empty hands and asks \u201cdo you not have any water?\u201d We were extremely confused as he had told us to leave our things on the boat and hadn\u2019t explained what we were doing. He says \u201cdon\u2019t worry, we are just doing a short 20-minute walk down the the track to a local village so you'll be fine.\u201d The guide didn't have any water either. My brother and I are a bit concerned, but by the time we turn around the boat has already left with our stuff (including our water, carefully chosen repellent etc), so we trust that we only have a short period of walking and we follow the guide down the track into the jungle.\n\nThe first 20 minutes are lovely and the guide is exemplary of what we had read online, pointing out interesting insects and telling us which ones to avoid, and showing us the safe places to step. At some point though, he leads us off the track and into the deep jungle. I\u2019m completely unconcerned and assuming this is all part of the plan. He tells us later that this is because he came across a large fallen tree over the track and we had to go around it.\n\nThings start to go a bit awry from here. We walk through the deep jungle for an hour or so, and our guide is becoming less responsible. He\u2019s charging ahead and leaving us to cut our own path (he doesn\u2019t have a machete or delicate instructions of where to step like the guides we read about online). We have to clamber over trunks, under vines, avoid vicious ants, and get stuck in mud. Luckily we didn\u2019t encounter anything more deadly; god knows it was definitely lurking. The mother who was with us fell over a few times and the guide didn't seem to care.\n\nEventually we make it to a small clearing and are starting to get a bit fed up, given we are yet to reach the village and are getting hungry, thirsty, sweaty, muddy and bitten. But, we are relieved to be out of the thick forest. The clearing has a basic bamboo shelter, and a little stream with two small aluminium boats. Is this the village? Our guide tells us to wait here and disappears for another half an hour without communicating anything to us, which is extremely irritating. He eventually returns and explains that we have to go back as \u201cthe boat that was meant to pick us up isn\u2019t there\u201d, which doesn\u2019t make any sense as we thought we were heading to a village. He says it will be 20 minutes maximum to get back to the river and, to our relief, starts leading us along a small dirt track. At this point (probably around 2pm) we just want to get back ASAP - we\u2019re hungry and thirsty. To our dismay, he shortly leads us off the track again back into the jungle, pointing at the sun and saying that he can tell which direction the river is in. Although annoyed that we have to wade through mud again, I still at this point have no suspicion that we are lost, and trust that he knows exactly where he\u2019s taking us. My brother isn\u2019t so sure, and says to us \u201cif he\u2019s using the sun as navigation I\u2019m not that confident about this\u201d. The rest of us laugh and follow our guide as all of the online advice told us to do. Stick with the guide, you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nWe stumble our way through the deep jungle without any assistance. By now, the guide is charging so far ahead that we can barely see him and have to keep yelling out to him. We are being bitten by red ants which is very painful, falling over and wading through mud, where we could hear running water bubbling underneath us. At one point, I fell thigh-deep into a muddy swamp and screamed, half expecting a caiman to bite my legs off (our gumboots would have come in handy if we hadn't been told leave them behind). The guide did not seem to care. At this point we scream to him to slow the fuck down and wait for us because this is extremely dangerous. He eventually does and stops to talk to us, saying that we should wait here (in the middle of nowhere) and his colleague will bring us food and water. Again, we are confused. He then leaves again into the jungle before we can stop him. We are in disbelief.  We look around and there is dense forest/swamp in all directions and we are being constantly bitten by mosquitos. We don't want to wait here for long, especially without water and repellent.\n\nHe returns a few minutes later looking extremely exhausted, having taken off his shirt, and collapses onto the forest floor. Between desperate gasps for breath, he finally drops the act and admits he has no idea where we are. We are completely lost.\n\nIt soon becomes clear that we have been lost for hours. We figure the guide was charging ahead to try and find a familiar path and completely exhausted himself doing so. He has collapsed shirtless on a muddy log, with loads of insects biting him. He is too exhausted to care. He is delirious and completely incoherent, seemingly forgetting how to speak English except to ask for water (which we didn\u2019t have) - luckily the daughter in our group could translate for us, because he managed to get a bit of phone reception and called his boss. We learned from her that he could not explain to his boss where on earth we were. He was even trying to describe the clearing with the two boats (which the boss did not recognise), showing that we were already lost all the way back then, and he had tried to hide it from us all that time. He had nothing with him to prepare for this situation: no flare, no water, no machete, no GPS, not even a compass.\n\nWe spend the next hour or so trying to think logically about how to survive. We got the guide\u2019s phone password and contacts as it seemed that we were going to lose him at any minute. Although I didn\u2019t have reception, my google map had partially loaded so that we could perhaps see the direction of the river and hack through the jungle to make our way to it and hopefully flag someone down. I was nervous about doing this because (1) it meant leaving the guide (who kept insisting he couldn't stand), leaving us without his knowledge of the jungle but also leaving him to die; (2) I really doubted whether the map was correct and (3) it would mean hours navigating the thick jungle by ourselves, risking encountering deadly animals, dangerous tribes, anything. And, we probably only had an hour of sunlight left...\n\nWe were all extremely thirsty and were trying not to panic, but things were not looking good. It was extremely hot and muddy, mosquitoes were flying everywhere, and we were on constant alert for snakes, spiders, jaguars etc. Everyone remained extremely calm and thought logically which was a blessing (the mother and I shared a hug; I think she suspected I was about to get upset), and we were so lucky to have the other two in our group, but it was looking like we were going to have to try and survive the night (or longer) in the Amazon jungle without water, without a guide, and without any of our supplies.\n\nThe daughter then manages to get a bit of reception on her phone and can speak directly to the boss herself, although we still have no way of describing our whereabouts. We send him a screenshot of my half-loaded map image. She contacts her boyfriend and tells him that she will likely die in the jungle and that she loves him, but can he please contact the authorities asap. We ask our guide what the emergency number in Peru is and he brazenly refuses to tell us (I guess because he was worried about getting in trouble). So does his pointless girlfriend.\n\nWe discuss our options, including the risk of leaving the guide behind, as he is still refusing to move or offer any advice despite our pleas. We eventually decide that, because the sun is going down and because of the risks associated with trying to get to the river, we are safer trying to go back the way we came and at least find the dirt track, which is safer from nature than the deep jungle and which also has a better chance of someone coming along the track and finding us. My brother is confident that he can remember the way back (I\u2019m not). The guide, realising that we are about to leave him here on his own, gets a new lease of life and we are able to heave him to his feet. He stumbles ahead behind my brother, and I\u2019m at the back with the other three girls. We are all trying not to break down.\n\nEventually, dozens of ant stings later, we hear a faint motor engine in the distance. We start screaming for help at the top of our lungs. To our dismay, it sounds like it has gone past without hearing us, but then we hear the noise stop. We keep screaming for our lives until, a few minutes later, we hear voices coming towards us through the jungle. We start crying with relief. Six villagers reach us, drag us back through the jungle, and load us onto a tray on the back of a motorbike, with water and biscuits. We learn that they are from one of the jungle villages who were contacted to go out looking for us, which is why they were on the track.\n\nI think by now it\u2019s about 4pm. The guide has  attempts to explain what happened, stating that he has over a decade of experience in the jungle and this has never happened before. We tell him that we just want to go home. He starts off saying it\u2019s not possible to get back to Iquitos tonight and that we will need to stay at the jungle lodge with him, but we won\u2019t take no for an answer. We don\u2019t trust him one bit with our safety. He eventually agrees to arrange for a boat to take us back.\n\nWe ride on the back of the motorbike for about half an hour, over bumpy terrain and occasionally getting stuck in the mud (it seems like this track hasn't been used in a long time). We are still being bitten by ants - my brother has hundreds stuck in his trousers. But we are all so thankful to be alive.\n\nOn our journey back, we learn that my map image was completely wrong and that it seemed to be a snapshot of my last downloaded location many hours ago. We also learn that the villagers on the bike didn\u2019t hear our screams over the motor - one of them happened to fall off at the exact right time, so they stopped the bike to let him back on and that\u2019s when they heard us.\n\nFrom speaking to locals and looking online, it seems like this is the first time a guided tour from Iquitos has got lost in the Amazon.\n\nWe eventually got back to the office expecting apologies and compensation. Obviously, the money is not important at all when compared to our survival. But, to our huge surprise, the boss said we couldn\u2019t get our money back because \u201cit\u2019s already been spent on the lodge\u201d. We argued and argued and he eventually agreed to give us some in cash back now and another portion later to our bank account, but we won\u2019t see that in our account for a couple of weeks and even then it would only be a bit over half what we paid. He basically called our bluff on bringing them to justice. He only gave the other two about half of theirs back as well. We ended up giving up as he was being pretty menacing and we felt unsafe, and just wanted to get the next flight out of there.\n\nOf course we plan to write a bad review for the company but we want to see the money first, although might cut our losses on that. We just feel like it\u2019s perverse that we were left to die in the jungle in extremely dangerous circumstances and it was completely the fault of the company that we put our trust in. They were severely negligent sending us with an incompetent guide without any supplies for the worst case scenario (which is what eventuated). It was an absolute death trap. We are still very shaken by the whole experience (this happened 4 days ago). And are also sad to have not had the adventure we dreamed about for ages.\n\nAlthough we were still a few hours or days off dying of thirst, the scary part was the prospect of having to survive the night, or longer, in the jungle alongside all the horrors of the Amazon and still being no closer to being found.\n\nOne of our group videoed the entire thing. We are hoping to get the footage from her and can post the link once we do.\n\nAny thoughts on what we can do are welcome. Thanks for reading!\n\nEDIT:\n\nName of tour company: Canopy Tours Iquitos\n\nItinerary and trip we booked was called Iquitos: Amazon Expedition 3 days, can find the itinerary on Get Your Guide, seems to not let me post with the link but should come up with a google and had good reviews on there.\n\nEDIT 2: we booked directly through the company\u2019s website after finding itinerary and reviews on GYG, their website can be found online too",

      "I would say San Diego but you've probably been there lol.  It does fit the bill for nightlife and nature though. \n\nIf you're college age Santa Barbara, CA is a smaller town but since UCSB is close they have some decent nightlife, and the nature nearby is second to none.",
      "Are you comfortable driving? I just came back from a long weekend in Atlanta and loved it. My gf and I wanted to get out of NYC and see some nature but she also likes to party. We spent 2 nights in Atlanta, not the best for city life tbh but they have great food, some fun clubs and great atmosphere. We then drove about an hour and a half north and stayed in the mountains at a little cabin. I would have liked to spend about a week up there just to hike and explore. It was right by the border of North Carolina and Tennessee so you could easily bounce around to a few different places. It was like being in 2 completely different worlds.\n\nAlso, NYC in the summer is also a great option, especially if you don't feel comfortable driving in the states. You can take the train to philly, dc, and boston very easily as well as some nice small towns in connecticut and upstate ny with great access to nature",
      "Seattle or Portland, Although the nightlife is kind of lacking here there are TONS of amazing nature things to do very close to the cities. But if you value nightlife over nature than LA or even Las Vegas. People don\u2019t really talk much about the Red Rocks right outside of Vegas but it is very beautiful if you\u2019re into desert nature.",
      "Savannah GA. Great nightlife and restaurants. Plenty of nature preserves 20 minutes in any direction!",
      "**Portland, Maine**\n\nGreat City, tons of nature around it and pretty good nightlife.",
      "Austin, TX. There's 6th Street for the nightlife you're looking for. And then there's the hill country surrounding it. Lots of nature!!",
      "I\u2019d say Portland if the nature has to be basically right there. Columbia river gorge and mount hood are spectacular.",

California night life sucks balls.\n\n\nEveryone closes at 2 but because of bar time they'll start kicking you out at 1:30\nBy law the venue has to be closed and locked up by 2am.\n Clubs and bars close 4-5am here!\nDJ doesn't get warned up till 2am when everyone is driving home in Cali.\n This is the birth place of House & acid jazz.\nJazz and blues grew up here.\n You don't have to DRIVE out here! Public transportation is safe and efficient\nRide shares  are cheaper here everything is close to each other in the city.\n\n Freshest dance music anywhere\n You can hit up a few places in Chicago without getting bored in a single night. \n You can do dinner a movie then get ready to go dancing.\n\nAs far as nature we have it all round. \n Kettle Moraine State Forest\nState park in Wisconsin,\nStarved Rock State Park is a incredible 40 minutes from the city and the city itself has over 50 miles of Beach lakefront Mind you the lake is not a little lake it's fuckin huge you can't see the other side it could be an inland ocean if it wasn't freshwater , it is so big it has it's own weather system separate from the land it's so huge.\nSwim, boat, surf, we have huge parties where boats gather in a group on the lake. We have rivers to kayak either in natural surroundings or with the arrival canyons of the sky scrapers. Which Chicago is the birth place of. The sky scrapers was born here. \n\n\n Y adem\u00e1s de todo eso hermano tenemos una comunidad enorme mexicana, aqu\u00ed todos hablamos espa\u00f1ol, la comida es incre\u00edble, si vas por la calle 26 vas a pensar que est\u00e1s en M\u00e9xico aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 tremendo! Ven a visitar, en serio te vas a enamorar de la ciudad\nCome visit! It isn't NewYork and nothing like LA ! Friendly and Clean. \nIts in the middle of everything!",
      "By stunning nature you mean the boys and the girls?\nLittle Rock AR\u2026. It has it all!!!! Honest!",
      "Austin Texas. straight-up gorgeous city with arguably the best music scene in the US. so many amazing parks all throughout the city and wonderful places to drive really close as well. the people are super friendly as well - I've made lifelong friends standing in line for food and waiting for the bus.\n\nas a second option, I can't speak to the quality of the nature, but New Orleans is probably the most fun I've had anywhere in the USA.",
      "I wouldn't recommend Portland, while it has a great proximity to nature, the city is going througb some rough times.",
      "NYC \n\nNightlife can\u2019t be touched by other US cities. \n\nUnderrated for close by nature. You\u2019ve got huge parks in northern Manhattan right along the Hudson River. Some with forest trails. Head a little further into the Bronx and you\u2019ve got Van Cortlandt, with great trails, rivers, nice woods. All accessible via subway. As others have mentioned, you can also take metro north or NJ transit to some more rural, and stunning spots. Hudson Valley is wonderful, with plenty of nature to go around.",
      "Vegas also! Surprisingly lots of nature around the city",
      "Atlanta! Many neighborhoods with different styles of nightlife and nature in and all around the city",
      "LA has some pretty great nature acccess. Mountains, beach, deserts; all within an hour or less. Only downside is you need to drive farther If you want to be peacefully alone; all the close spots a usually busy. Within a 4hr drive there are some world class spots: eastern sierra, Big Sur, anza borrego, Joshua tree, Sequoia NP. The other factor is you have 327days a year that you can comfortably enjoy the outside\n\nI think the nightlife speaks for itself.",
      "Denver has decent nightlife and you can hit Boulder/Colorado Springs/RMNP for nature.",
      "Surprised I'm not seeing SF/Oakland higher up. Tons of great local hiking, Muir Woods, and plenty of nightlife. Midweek, it's pretty easy to get a campsite on Angel Island, if you want one of the coolest urban+nature experiences you can get. Very easy to get to from Tijuana.\n\nWould also second Portland and Seattle. I tried to do a trip like this to Nashville once, and the nature was either farther away or nice, but not phenomenal. New Orleans, Vegas, and Miami would also work, if you don't mind the heat right now.",
      "New Orleans was mentioned but I'll second that option.\n\nIt's famous for nightlife, and depending on what you want out of \"nature\", but great hiking, kayaking, fishing, and not long of a drive to get to a nice beach.\n\nAnd the food!!!",
      "I\u2019d go with San Francisco- second busiest metropolitan area in the state (after LA) and has easy access to ALOT of nature",
      "You\u2019re close to San Diego, so maybe you\u2019re familiar with it, but it\u2019s a very nice and relaxed place. The Pacific Beach area has some fun bars, as does the Gaslamp Quarter. For nature, you could explore the Mission Trails regional park and/or the cliffs along the ocean, or San Diego Zoo. \n\nAlternatively, Seattle and Vancouver have some beautiful nature surrounding them. Vancouver has a bit more going on re: nightlife",
      "Denver. Lots of nightlife pockets and tons of incredible accessible nature. I live here, over a decade now, and love it.",
      "I recommend visiting Austin, Texas! The city has a vibrant nightlife with live music and great bars, and it's surrounded by stunning nature like Barton Springs and the Greenbelt."

      "I live in Denver and love it, so I can offer my perspective. Denver is a city of neighborhoods. If you just visited LoDo, you missed out on the majority of Denver. During the summer, there are tons of markets and festivals to visit, and they take place along different areas. Historically, there were a lot of neighborhoods built around street cars. These no longer exist, but they make up some of the more walkable areas like Platt Park, Wash Park, Cap Hill, Tennyson, etc. these areas tend to have more restaurants, events, or stores. \n\nDenver also has interesting roots. It was very much a wild west town, so you can find a lot of cool historical tours, art, and museums focused on western history, indigenous populations, and cowboy shit. The Western Stock show is a huge deal when it runs in the winter. There was and still is a significant Hispanic population in Denver, so if you're in what was previously known as Denver's Northside (along the Federal Blvd corridor) or near Aurora, you run into super great food and more interesting events/art. Aurora and Federal in general have a ton of great food because different ethnic populations have been in that area. \n\nThis is also a passionate sports city if you're into sports. We have all major professional teams, and some of them are even good. They just purchased a women's soccer league expansion, which will start playing next year and have a new stadium built by 2027. \n\nThere's also some strong subcultures and communities in the area! For the nerds, you can play DnD and boardgames in a lot of different places, there are independent bookstores and reading groups, LARPers, an entire pirate cosplay organization, Renaissance festival enthusiasts and more. There's a local Pro Wrestling circuit. There's a strong drag and queer scene. There's a great kink community. Lots of music enthusiasts and scenes because we have great venues. Like, if you are passionate about anything, there's an active group for it in Denver.\n\nAnd obviously, people like nature. Within the city, there are lots of parks, the botanic gardens, arboretums with champion trees, open spaces with hiking, biking infrastructure, state parks...\n\nIf you're going to the same instagram-ready restaurants for white people who have a handlebar moustache, drink beer, and think a Patagonia vest over a T-shirt is fashion.... And that's not your thing, then you're going to have a bad time. Although, if that is your thing, this is definitely a place for you lol.",
      "Denver museum of nature and science? Meow Wolf? Did you hit those?",
      "I grew up in Denver and I love the architecture downtown (Did you know the library was made to look like multiple buildings in order to balance out having downtown on only one side of Civic Center Park?, the cash register building, DAM, our capitol building domed with real gold, that new building designed to look like a stand of aspen trees??), I love that Botanic Gardens is on top of the old cemetery, I love that Molly Brown House is obsessed with the Titanic (Titanic trivia night next week, guys!), I love that the current nineties exhibit at History Colorado has a lil' tribute to Klondike and Snow the blockbuster polar bear cubs of my youth, I love the quiet old-timeyness of the diorama halls in Museum of Nature and Science (and their Sci Fi summer film series), I love the Western Floor (and the view!) at the Denver Art Museum (and that the whole Hamilton building feels like it'd be an amazing place to play laser tag). Today specifically: I love the Jury Room in Pints Pub. \n\nMaybe Denver feels mid on the surface because - as evidenced by this thread - so many people who've moved here make 'liking the mountains on weekends' a big chunk of their personality. You all are missing out.",
      "Yeah, Denver isn\u2019t a standard American city in where the downtown has much going on as it\u2019s more a financial district/sports/transportation center. There are a few cool things/streets in the downtown, but other than that, you have to seek out the nice neighborhoods outside of the downtown. Cherry creek, RiNo, Highlands, etc. I think Denver lends itself nicely to surrounding areas and proximity to nature, which is why it is a destination, but you have to get out of the city to experience that. Last time I visited Denver, I spent little time in the downtown and more time in several of the neighborhoods, Boulder, Golden, and in Conifer hiking/ziplining. In winter time, Denver serves as the place to fly into to enjoy winter sports, so in my mind, the actual city is a means to an end??",

      "OP I am so, so with you. Denver is a city I want to love, but it\u2019s so preventably not good, and everyone defends it for some reason. Saying \u201cit\u2019s about the proximity to nature\u201d is willfully missing the point. The city sucks, and it really shouldn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t have great city amenities, the airport isn\u2019t super convenient, and when controlled for traffic and lack of infrastructure, the proximity to nature isn\u2019t that great, either. \n\nI wanted to move there and then when I visited my bestie I could not for the life of me understand the hype.",

      "Denver is bland. If you want picturesque nature it\u2019s a bit of a drive or many miles of hiking.",
      "Denver is a pretty nice place to live, but unless you are looking to take advantage of the proximity to the mountains for outdoorsy activities, it doesn't have a whole lot that another major city wouldn't do better for visitors. It looks like you aren't seeking out the mountains, in particular, so if you go back:\n\n\nNumber 1 recommendation: See a concert at Red Rocks (or if that's not feasible, check out one of the other events like a Film on the Rocks movie night).\u00a0\n\n\nLow-brow nightlife: bar hop down South Broadway, where lots of run-down little places have survived the gentrification that has eliminated that kind of thing in the rest of the city, and check out a small show at a venue like the hi-dive. Come back for brunch at Sputnik (do this anyway; nothing beats their bloody Mary and Cuban sandwich at noon on a Sunday).\n\n\nMiddle brow nightlife: also South Broadway, visit the cocktail bars and maybe see if there's anything cool at the Skylark Lounge (they host things in partnership with the local public radio indie music station); or, check out the capital hill/Colfax\u00a0\n\n\nUpscale nightlife: Denver is not a good place for this at all.\n\n\nFood: see r/denverfood. It's not exactly a destination city for food, but anyone should be able to stay a week without having a single bad meal or repeating themselves. Denver has a ton of mediocre places that are over hyped, so be careful just going off of online reviews and articles. Denver doesn't have a Chinatown, exactly, but the best \"ethnic\" dishes are often found in cultural enclaves that surround the city (West Denver/Federal Blvd/Morrison Road area; parts of Aurora)\n\n\nCulture: Central Denver/cap hill has the Denver Art Museum and several other high-quality museums in a fairly small radius. The nature and science museum is good, too. Still, those simply aren't on the same level as places you could go if you were in New York, Chicago, DC... The zoo is top-tier, of that's the kind of thing you enjoy. The aquarium is a sad joke and should be avoided. Meow Wolf is pretty great, although I think I will always prefer the original in NM.\n\n\nDenver also has a great queer scene with a bunch of great bars, clubs and venues.\n\n\nWater World is an excellent water park.\n\n\nElitch's is a terrible amusement park.\n\n\nHighlands (northwest of downtown) and downtown are devoid of almost all culture and community and should be drive-in, drive-out destinations if you are headed to a particular restaurant or whatever. Lodo and rino aren't a ton better, but there are pockets that are worth hanging around in.\n\n\nMiscellaneous plug: There is a book store/printing press/socialist collective/intersectional community organization called Matter in lodo that is definitely worth a visit if any of that interests you.",
      "I felt the same about Denver. Traveling around Denver and experiencing the nature stuff was great but you described it the exact way I felt about it and I\u2019ve heard others describe it as well.",
      "Denver sucks. I say that as a Coloradoan. It's a soulless strip mall of a city with no particular culture. \n\nColorado is great for nature and some of our smaller towns and cities. Fort Collins and Boulder for fun college towns. Mountain towns like Estes Park, Crested Butte, Nederland, Ouray, Glenwood Springs, and many more. Western slope has beautiful wineries and orchards, like in Palisade and Paonia. \n\nDenver is just the shitty traffic you have to drive through to get to good things."

This time, I tried to \"do more local stuff\" hoping to get away from that........oh no, the merchants still aggressively swarm you as if you are fresh meat in a zombie apocolypse movie.

Probably nearly got in a fight a dozen times.  I am a nice person by nature, but for the first time, not only do I have to be outright mean to these sorts of people........I actually got a degree of pleasure shouting them away this time.  Additionally, the carpet, leather, and jewelry guys also simply do not relent now.........\"law enforcement\" sees it,  and does absolutely nothing about it (probably because they are getting their cut too).  I challenge you.........as a tourist.......go try and sit on a bench by Blue Mosque.  If you can make it one minute without a hustler trying to sell you their shit, that would be slightly impressive.\n\nThe last day we legitimately stayed in the hotel room the whole time and didnt leave the hotel property.

It is by far my favourite country to visit, but as I\u2019m more of a nature guy it\u2019s hard to get short visits in. I detest the cities like Shanghai, which I was in earlier this month and couldn\u2019t wait to leave. I\u2019m a fairly advanced Mandarin speaker, which is extremely helpful, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do 70% of the things I do without it. I do stick out like a sore thumb in some places as a foreigner, but people here bend over backwards to help you even if they seem a bit awkward or gruff to begin with, it\u2019s just how they are.\n\n\nI\u2019ve visited much more than I\u2019ve pictures, but I\u2019m limited to 20 photos so I\u2019ve just randomly selected the ones I like:\n\n1. Huashan, I couldn\u2019t capture the grandeur of this mountain range no matter how hard I tried. The cable cart I took there (take the expensive one) was the longest and highest I\u2019ve ever taken by several orders of magnitude. Some opt to climb the mountain but they are missing out on a truly spectacular experience. If you\u2019re adventurous, you can also the \u201cplank walk\u201d they have here, YouTube it.\n\n2. Chongqing, although I don\u2019t like cities much, this vibrant city was truly something else. It\u2019s been pretty viral recently. One little thing I found quite surreal was going into a subway entrance and having to the escalator **up** to take the underground. \n\n3. Chengdu Panda reserve, in my favourite city, perhaps because it\u2019s known as the \u201cslow\u201d city in China. Also the food is my favourite. \n\n4-5. Xian, an amazing city with so much more than what I\u2019ve shown. The old city wall is so vast both in width and length that I didn\u2019t include a picture just because I felt like it doesn\u2019t really show the true scale.\n\n\n6-7. Longmen Grottoes, 10000s of Buddhas dating back to the Han Dynasty 1500+ years ago. You can go during the day or in the evening like I did. Again it\u2019s hard to me capture the serial in these ancient sculptures, which can be enormous like the ones I\u2019ve shown or minuscule carved into rows along cave walls. Also this place is by one of the ancient capitals in China , Luoyang, which has a fantastic museum and ancient city.\n\n8-10. Beijing, visited back in 2010 and it\u2019s changed a lot since then. A lot busier and a lot of security, but the air has also cleaned up and there\u2019s so much history to unravel. My favourite thing to do was walk the quiet hutongs.\n\n11-14, Jiuzaigou. First pic was in March, second was taken in October, both the same lake. This place has something different to offer every season. If you walk a bit from the main path/drop-off points, you can be completely alone. I had some absolutely serene moments just listening to the rivers and birds. I\u2019m only showing 1% of what this gorgeous valley has to offer.\n\n15-16, Xishuangbanna. Like Thailand, but China. You can take the train to Laos from here in under an hour. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t get to really dig into the local jungles and villages, I would love to come back when China opens up to foreigner driving licenses.\n\n17-18, Yubeng. A gorgeous hiking range where I stayed for a few days in various hostels/inns around the area. You can see Tibetan pilgrims visiting sacred waterfalls, and shop owners shoo away Yaks who get too close to their customers/food. Again, showing 1% of what this place has to offer.\n\n19. Lugu Lake. Home to a matriarchal ethnic minority. If you cycle round the lake you\u2019re in Sichuan for one half and Yunnan for the other.\n\n20. Yangshuo. Gorgeous karst mountains for as far as the eye can see. Also this place is very beginner friendly as far as China goes.\n\nI\u2019ve barely covered half of what I got to see, and barely scratched the surface of what I want to do. My next goal is to learn how to camp, and go hike around Daocheng Yading for a week or two. I\u2019d also like to visit the golden snub nosed monkeys in a reserve where you can get up close in Pingwu. A lot of the more interesting and esoteric spots in China aren\u2019t easily researched on the this side of the great firewall, but that\u2019s what makes China so rewarding.",

Also, looking for somewhere relatively affordable (budget under 3000) but also safe since I am 25 and have bright blonde hair... I won\u2019t have a car. I will also be staying in hostels (private room though). \n\nI\u2019m debating between Costa Rica (la fortuna, monteverde and Manuel Antonio) or Mexico (Mexico city, tulum, bacalar). \n\nDoes anyone have advice on what place is more worth it in terms of most beautiful landscape and beaches? \n\nThank you!",

      "Mexico has the better beaches and Costa Rica has the better nature. CR has the highest density of biodiversity in the world, with 12 different ecosystems and nearly every rain forest possible. The beaches are awesome but mexicos are more beautiful. But CR is more expensive and Mexico has better food. Just depends what you\u2019re going for.",
      "If you want good beaches, nature AND culture, then Mexico is a better choice. \n\nDon\u2019t do Tulum, not a good destination anymore and not great for solo travelers or anyone wanting to get a good Mexican experience. \n\nCheck out Oaxaca. You can do Oaxaca City for culture, art, pre-Hispanic ruins and the best representation of real Mexican food culture. \n\nThen you can easily go to Puerto Escondido and Mazunte for beach and more of a coastal culture. This is a great spot for young solo travelers, it\u2019s a great vibe. There are some great surf schools there I can connect you to.",
      "The beaches in Mexico are better. Nature is probably a draw, but I\u2019d say CR is better. Mexico has more culture.",
      "Ok. Been in all this places. \n\n1. As of beaches to swim Mexico is the better place. However Manuel Antonio is really nice but the best beach is in the national park and you have to pay and walk all the time to stay there. It's not the best to swim either. More waves than most Yucatan peninsula. Then again you could always go from Costa Rica to the islands of Panama and then it's a diffrent game.. If you a surfer, then CR is ofcource better then Yucatan. Mexico has way better food also.\n\nNature out of those two, even if Mexico is big, then Costa Rica wins hands down (cant compare at all). Costa Rica is also a safer country (way safer) but also more expencive. Party, then Mexico win hands down and problably way easier to find others to hang with, even if doable in CR aswell. So it may depend on such as well.\n\nManuel Antonio is beautiful (super nice with a beach just by a rainforest with lots of animals ; ) )but also very much fixed for tourists and many trails one is restricted to. Corcovado is more getting in to the rainforest for real. Only Souht America or Borneo that can compare to that. Monteverde is nice. If you got time go to Arenal awell. Even if a build up Tabacon hot springs is a gem .\n\nBtw. All the places you mentioned in Costa Rica is very very safe. But mostly it's quiet safe in the places you mentioned in Mexico too. But CR can only be compared with Chile and Uruguay in Latin America. It's very very safe.\n\nAs to Mexico however, even if Ilove Tulum, it might be booring to go alone. Little bit more chartered to couples I'm afraid. Then there are lots of other places that might be more fun around there. Just stay away from Cancun (totally non genuine). Again Mexico has really good food.",
      "Mexico is infinitely more culturally rich than Costa Rica - history, food, architecture, etc.\n\nCosta Rica probably has better nature, for wildlife at least. \n\nMake sure you avoid \"touristy\" beaches in Mexico. I LOVE Mexico but hate Puerto Vallarta and Cancun. I'm not a beach person so I don't have a great beach recommendation. \n\nMexico City isn't near a beach but it's an incredible city. Also, go to Chiapas / San Cristobal de Las Casas.\n\nCheck out Xcalak for a very isolated beach, super cool and close enough to the 2nd largest reef.",
      "Costa Rica can't be beat for nature. Especially if you visit the Monteverde area and manage to secure a tour of Corcovado, which should be done in advance. Mexico is better for literally everything else, especially food and culture. Mexico is also vast so if you have more time, you will be able to see a greater variety of beaches and ecosystems. If snorkeling and diving is your thing, I would avoid Costa Rica.",
      "La fortune is stunning. \n\nIt\u2019s totally different vibes though. Costa Rica is much more of a rainforest/jungle place, with sort of an island vibe to it. Mexico is beaches and what most of us think of as Spanish culture. Both are beautiful, just depends what your looking for and what type of nature you prioritize.",
      "Food/gastronomy = Mexico\n\nCulture = Mexico\n\nArt = Mexico\n\nArchitecture = Mexico\n\nBUT\u2026.Outdoor adventure/adrenaline rush activities and nature/wildlife  = Costa Rica\n\nINSANELY gorgeous life-changing nature of cloud forests/rainforests/jungle/LUSH GREEN like you\u2019ve never seen in your life and biodiversity of species AND waterfalls galore = Costa Rica. There\u2019s a REASON why people all across the world have bucket list dream of seeing sloths hanging from trees and monkeys jumping around with literally volcanoes and rainforests and 300 foot waterfalls in the background and most insanely colorful birds (toucans, Quetzales, Scarlet Macaws). \n\nCosta Rica invented ziplining. Costa Rica is world famous for whitewater rafting, top 5 in world FACT (research Pacuare River Rafting). Costa Rica made the sport called \u201cwaterfall rappelling\u201d famous. Just Google the word rapelling, specifically waterfall rapelling. Costa Rica has become the global representation when people think of hiking, outdoor activities, adrenaline rush, nature etc (although let\u2019s be fair, also synonymous with these topics is New Zealand, Iceland, and Patagonia).\n\nCosta Rica has become globally synonymous with \u201c\u201dwellness tourism.\u201d\u201d Fact\u2026just simply Google the words \u201cwellness tourism\u201d or \u201cyoga retreats\u201d and watch your first few pages be dominated by Costa Rica. Also surf retreats and surf culture\u2026just the whole damn package Costa Rica has made famous. Costa Rica is often the first country that comes to mind when people think of yoga retreats, wellness-focused meditation destinations etc (besides Bali of course). \n\nTo Mexico\u2026you have Tulum\u2026great, but in terms of the bohemian yogi new-age progressive wellness crowd, Santa Teresa and Nosara in Costa Rica way better. And yes, for surfing you do have Puerto Escondido\u2026aka the \u201cMexican Pipeline,\u201d but again Costa Rica has endless after endless swells in soooo many beach towns such as Santa Teresa, Nosara, Salsa Brava, Witch\u2019s Rock area, Dominical, Pavones"

    "selftext": "Wife and I did a month in South Africa for our honeymoon this September. Covered the Western Cape, Kruger, and Garden Route with a total of 3 rental cars and 2 domestic flights. \n\nExcluding international flights, we spent $3500 per person for accom, food, activities. It was honestly the best decision we could've made. The whole country was just one amazing experience after another. Some highlights:\n\n1. Table Mountain's flat top was surreal, followed by the sheer drop of a view looking down at Cape Town.\n\n2. Staying by the train tracks in Kalk's Bay felt like being in a coastal town in Japan. Had fish and chips by the sea watching seals play.\n\n3. Got to share a beach with actual African penguins, which was wild.\n\n4. Did whale watching (right from shore!) in Hermanus, then an ocean safari where we lucked out with a 30min sighting of humpbacks, seals, and dolphins working together to feed. Our boat was right in the thick of it and was rocked the entire time. Pure fun chaos.\n\n6. Stayed in a modern barn in Stellenbosch with amazing farm/mountain views. Did a couple of affordable, chill wine tastings too. The wife loved Stardew Valley and said our time here felt exactly like being in the game.\n\n7. Surprisingly, driving. Roads are great and scenery constantly changes from mountains to coastline to wilderness.\n\n8. Spent 3 days self-driving the Kruger in a Toyota. No schedule, no rush\u2014just us stopping anywhere we wanted to, waiting at waterholes, and sharing the excitement of the occasional rare sighting. This was a perfect honeymoon moment.\n\n9. Did a 4D3N wilderness trail (walking safari) in the Kruger. Had a half-hour standoff with 3 lionesses and 6 cubs, got close to a massive 400+ buffalo herd, and had to silently crouch and back away from some elephants. Being on foot was a way different experience than driving.\n\n10. Stayed at a dreamy beach house in Wilderness. Dolphins during breakfast and miles of pristine beach. This was after our Kruger adventure and was a very welcome respite from all the dust, dirt, heat.\n\n11. Bungee jumping at about $130+ pp. Felt safe and the guys there were absolutely pros. Got a very decent video out of it.\n\n12. Did a small township tour in Plett. For those few hours we became proper tourists gawking at local life. It was...not pretty. But it gave real perspective on government initiatives and the uglies that many South Africans still face today. My usually-cautious wife was surprised at how much she appreciated the experience. Planning to do the bigger Cape Town ones next time.\n\n13. For us, Tsitsikamma (Storms River) was hands down THE most beautiful location in SA. We stayed 3 days but could've easily spent a week there and still wanted more. The hiking trails were fantastic and well-kept. Our cabin's location was perfect\u2014mountains and forests out back, Indian Ocean out front. A surprise bonus was seeing the Milky Way and stars at night.\n\nAbout the elephant in the room...safety. With so many reports of murders, carjackings, muggings, etc. we weren't keen to appear on the news. I prepared a dossier of sorts with all safety tips and to-dos, memorized it then briefed the wife on the flight to SA. In general, no driving at night, keep to safer areas, no visible belongings in cars, etc. We were in our accoms by 7pm every night, except for one late dinner in Dullstroom (which felt safe enough). This worked out pretty okay as most days started early anyways. After a week all these precautions just became routine. We didn't meet any crime throughout our time here. Only hassle was some persistent vendors in Camps Bay.\n\nFor anyone planning a similar trip, September was perfect timing. Cold but good for outdoor stuff in Cape Town, great for wildlife in Kruger (daytime temps from 57\u00b0F - 95\u00b0F). This year saw a cold front all spring\u2014at one point in Mpumalanga (near the Kruger) temperatures at night hit 30\u00b0F which was unusually cold for this time of year. We brought barely enough layers, but most places we stayed at provided heaters. Nights were generally very cold and we saw snow-capped mountains while driving along highways.\n\nWe mixed up our stays between Airbnbs, boutique hotels and guest houses, which I'd be happy to recommend. If anyone's curious about specific locations, prices, or activities, feel free to ask! Looking through these photos makes me nostalgic already.\n\nTLDR: If you love nature, South Africa is a must visit. You get mountains, oceans, and safaris all in one trip. Hard to find this combo anywhere else, especially at these prices. Food, stays, and activites are super reasonable, and nice areas feel European-level comfortable. Only real issue is safety, so I'd prep some risk tolerance and LOTS of vigilance. Be prepared to make compromises, but imo few places offer such rich rewards for those willing to make the effort. We stayed a month, followed basic safety rules, and had zero problems. ",

      "Mundrothuruthu is an inland island group located at the confluence of Ashtamudi Lake and the Kallada River, in Kollam district, Kerala, South India. It is a group of eight small islets comprising a total area of about 13.4 km2. The island, accessible by road, rail and inland water navigation, is about 25 kilometres (16 mi) from Kollam by road, 38 kilometres (24 mi) north from Paravur, 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) west from Kundara and about 25 kilometres (16 mi) from Karunagapally. As of the 2011 Indian census, the administrative village of Mundrothuruth (which includes nearby small villages as well) has a total population of 9599, consisting of 4636 males and 4963 females. This island is also known as \"Sinking Island of Kerala\"\n\n\nThe island village is a tourism destination where one can see the coir retting process, coir weaving, fishing, prawns feeding, migratory bird watch, narrow canals and waterways, coconut farms on the lake shore, lagoons, mangrove plants and the beautiful tiny islands of Pathupara.\nKallada Boat Race, which is one of the famous boat races in Kerala, is at Karuvathrakadavu- Muthiraparambu nettayam in Munroe Island.\n\n\nIn 1795 the British established their supremacy in South India and the princely state of Travancore came under their governance. From 1800 onwards, a Resident was appointed by East India Company as administrative head of Travancore. The first Resident was Colonel Colin Macaulay, followed by Colonel John Munro. During his tenure Munro oversaw the land reclamation efforts in the delta where Kallada River joins Ashtamudi Lake and the reclaimed island was named after him as Munroe Island. The Dutch Church here in Munroe Island is one of the ancient churches in Kerala. It was built by the Dutch in 1878. The red brick church is a blend of Dutch-Kerala architecture on the scenic banks of Lake Ashtamudi.\nThe villagers depended on coconut coir manufacturing as livelihood, however, post Indian Ocean tsunami, things have changed.",

The place in the images above is a small rural town in the northwest of Tunisia (Tunisia is a north African country), called \"sidi Amara\" which means m 'my master Amara' or 'sir Amara'. the nature there is stunning and inspiring, there are a lot of green, rosemary scent, colorful flowers, bees buzzing, troops of sheeps... As for my trajectory, I've walked 6.8 km round trip on day 1, 11.6 on day 2 and 13.6 on the third day.my goal is to reach 20 km by the end of May.

It's used in arguments about topics ranging from sexuality to vaccination to military service, and many more!\n\nI do some volunteer work off-trail in the rainforests of Western Washington. It's wet, like, all the time, and we're always bush-whacking. I usually wear a Gore-Tex-style hard shell top and bottoms, gators, and wool or synthetic base/mid layers. I'm just another Patagonia-striped zebra in the Pacific Northwestern heard.\n\nAnywho, I was day dreaming the other day, and some disembodied voice was all, \"Hey Man. That's stuff's all, like, plastic. That's messed up, Man.\" Now, I totally get that whatever spirit said that probably smelled like body odor and patchouli, but it got me thinking. **What if I wanted to go as non-plastic as possible for my technical outdoor gear? What plant- or animal-derived materials would be the best-suited for high-output activities in heavy rain?**\n\nI know the bushcraft crowd loves their waxed canvas, but that seems to be more of a *Mountain* West thing, where it's quite a bit dryer.

    "selftext": "1. Salvador, Brazil \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7\n\nSalvador has the most contagiously positive and resilient people I've ever met, while being very progressive and not in denial of social problems. The music video for \"They Don't Care About Us\" by Michael Jackson was mostly filmed in Salvador after all. Socializing with Baianos feels like being hit by a ray of sunshine that fills your body. Ax\u00e9, now one of my favourite genres of music, is an example of that energy. Everyone in Salvador knows how to dance. It's the kind of city where you can run into a random parade of people dancing and playing music in the middle of the day, or spend hours in a music shop chatting to the owner about Brazilian music. The image people have of Rio feels more true of Salvador. The people are much friendlier than in Rio, their Carnival is the biggest in Brazil, and a lot of Brazilian culture originates from Salvador and Bahia largely due to its majority Afro-Brazilian population. The city is often labelled as \"The Most African City outside of Africa\". The city is also famous for candombl\u00e9, a syncretic Afro-Brazilian religion where West African deities, orix\u00e1s, are linked with Roman Catholic saints. It was created as a way for African slaves to preserve their religions, which were made illegal during slavery\n\n2. Istanbul, Turkey \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 \n\nI describe Istanbul as New York for Liberal Arts students, but prettier. The historical layers to this city mixed with its charming streets, hills and architecture is unmatched. Turkish hospitality is also unmatched. They are so generous to the point where you feel guilty for taking so much even though they offered it in the first place. I know that things have changed politically in recent years, but when I was there I saw a goth chick wearing head-to-toe black smoking a cigarette and chatting with a woman wearing a hijab. Where else could you see two different worlds collide so casually and peacefully? The street cats are also adorable. The fact that locals are all on board when it comes to taking care of the street cats says a lot about their character. Where else in the world would you see a handsome businessman at a caf\u00e9 petting a street cat on his lap while working on his laptop?\n\n3. Berlin, Germany \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea \n\nOne of the few cities where people really mean it when they say they party hard. Anything goes! If you wanted to party non-stop from Friday night until Monday morning, you probably could. However, there are many large quiet green spaces to get away from the nightlife too. The cleanliness of West Berlin and the grunge of East Berlin is a fascinating historical juxtaposition. The thing that made me realize how inclusive and amazing this city is was when I learned that they put tape on your phone's camera while entering clubs because refugees (mostly gay) from Syria had photos of themselves leaked to their families and governments back home. The fact most people are on board with such an inclusive policy says a lot about the city's character\n\n4. S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 \n\nIt feels like being in a giant city from an anime. The nightlife is so social that you can go out and party while making friends any night of the week. People there work hard and play hard! It's truly a city that never sleeps and where almost any subculture can find their place and feel included. As a gay person, I was happy to see so many gay couples holding hands in public. It is incredibly diverse, with the largest Italian, Lebanese, Syrian, Japanese and African diasporas of any city in the world. It's one of those rare cities where the more congested and busy it gets, the more alive you feel. S\u00e3o Paulo wouldn't be S\u00e3o Paulo without it. It adds to the feeling of its neverending people, neverending opportunities and its neverending skyline\n\n5. Melbourne, Australia \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\n\nMelbourne is incredibly laid back and beautiful. A big city with small town friendliness and a good campy sense of humour. It has the world's largest urban tram network, with trams running down its beautiful wide streets dotted with trees, colourful opulent Victorian architecture, and zany experimental modern architecture. There is something for everyone in Melbourne: nightlife, art, cuisine, business, beaches, sport, academia, nature, entertainment, LGBT culture, progressive spaces, etc. The thriving caf\u00e9 culture, and the fact that Starbucks barely exists there, is also a highlight. Being situated on a windy bay with low humidity, summer is so pleasant there to the point where 43\u2070C days can feel tolerable or even pleasant. Melbourne has the largest Greek, Macedonian, Maltese, Timorese and Singaporean diasporas of any city in the world. Melbourne is very culturally diverse, yet everyone is still very much a Melburnian. Diverse friend groups are a very common sight compared to Sydney where cliques based on ethnicity or race are a more common sight. I describe Melbourne to people as the San Francisco of Australia, or the Tropical London\n\n6. Antigua, Guatemala \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf9\n\nAntigua has stunning colonial architecture with a lot of backpackers who go there to take Spanish classes. Therefore, the relationship between tourism and local life here feels immersive and harmonious. It has the perfect climate due to its altitude, with daily highs between 20-25\u2070C year-round and a healthy balance of sun and rain. You can see Volc\u00e1n del Fuego periodically erupting in the skyline only 16 km away. You can even do a hike up Acatenango, situated next to Fuego, to see it erupting up close! The world's largest Easter celebrations take place in the streets of Antigua. I also had the best coffee of my life in Antigua, a honey soy latte at Coffea Caf\u00e9s Especiales\n\n7. Taghazout, Morocco \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\udde6\n\nTaghazout is a charming Berber fishing village that is also a haven for surfers with an even split of Moroccan and international tourists. The village still has a strong local feel and hasn't been overrun by tourism yet, with all the surfing instructors being locals. When leaving your hostel, you mostly see locals going about their business and children playing in the streets. The mountains in the background could almost give you the impression that you're in Cape Town. The areas of the beach closer to the village are dotted with stunning traditional Moroccan buildings and the occasional camel. I ended up staying for two weeks and I felt like a calmer and healthier person after. It was here where I discovered that argan oil is the only thing that makes my pale freckly skin tan, which made me very happy. The town is quite hilly, so your hostel will most likely have a stunning ocean view for less than $10/night\n\n8. La Paz, Bolivia \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf4\n\nArguably the most unique city in the world. With altitudes of up to 13,600 feet, it is the highest big city in the world. Due to its hilliness, it has a gondola public transit system with a daily ridership of 300,000 passengers. 21,000 foot snowcapped mountains dominate the skyline and breathtaking desert valleys are within the city limits. There's a witches market that comes to life during a full moon. It's very refreshing to find a big city where people are proud of their Native American culture and still speak Native American languages. The lack of Western influences (Starbucks and McDonald's) is also very refreshing. Even struggling to breath while walking up its hilly streets is part of the unique experience\n\n9. Aswan, Egypt \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddec \n\nIt was 47\u2070C while I was in Aswan, which is the hottest temperature I've ever experienced. However, that just enhanced the experience. The heat, ancient temples, perfume palaces, sand dunes, colourful Nubian villages and peaceful urban parks filled with palm trees were all so beautiful. My first memory of Aswan was a man on the side of the road with a bright smile waving at the bus as it entered the city. People in Aswan had infectious bright smiles and were very relaxed compared to the rest of Egypt. Perhaps it's due to the city's Nubian influence and proximity to the Sudanese border. Just over the dam are thousands of crocodiles that thankfully never enter the city. While monuments in nearby Luxor might be more appealling, Aswan feels like an actual city that people live in rather than a city that thrives on tourism.\n\n10. Rabat, Morocco \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\udde6\n\nRabat is the national capital while also being one of Morocco's four imperial cities. This leads to a blend of cool modern architecture with Saharan influences along with beautiful traditional architecture, such as my favourite medina in all of Morocco. The white and beige colours of Rabat's buildings along the blue ocean are so soothing. Not only are the smells and breeze of the ocean felt throughout Rabat, but one can also surf in Rabat. What more can you ask for? The city also has the best quality of life in Morocco and has an extensive tram system",

Chenrezig, but there's other longer treks that you can do in the area if you have more time. \n\nTo get here, you can fly into Daocheng and then take a short bus ride, but I'd recommend taking the [overland route from Chengdu to Shangri-La](https://onthewayaround.com/overland-chengdu-shangri-la/) instead. If you take the overland route, you get to see some incredible Tibetan scenery and culture as you ascend onto the Tibetan Plateau from the Chinese lowlands. \n\nIf you want more info or to see more photos from the trek, [check out my blog](https://onthewayaround.com/guide-to-trekking-in-the-yading-nature-reserve/) :)"
