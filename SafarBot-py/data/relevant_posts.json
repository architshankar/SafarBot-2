    "selftext": "Simple question.\n\nFor me it\u2019s India. If you ask me what\u2019s my favorite food specifically, I couldn\u2019t tell you, I usually just ask for recommendations and I always end with something different and it\u2019s always delicious. I enjoy the Thalis a lot though, cause they offer a lot of variety in one meal. Also the breads are always superb.\n\nIt is the only country where after traveling for now 3 weeks, I never had a thought of munching a pizza/western food.\n\nLong story short: which country did you enjoy most in terms of food?",

      "Mexico - so many cool places and the food is simply amazing.",
      "Lebanon was a food haven for me! Everything I tried was absolutely delicious.",
      "Anything on the Med for me: Greece, Italy, Monaco, Turkey. The fresh seafood, the olive oil, feta cheese, pizza, you name it, I love it lol",
      "Georgian food is delicious. I've never actually been to Georgia (it's high on my must visit list) but I visited Russia in 2019 and Georgian food is very popular there.\n\nSome of my favourites dishes are\n\n* [Khachapuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khachapuri), cheese bread of which there are many varieties\n* [Khinkali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khinkali), dumplings\n* [Chakapuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakapuli), stew\n* [Chashushuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chashushuli), stew\n* [Pkhali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkhali). minced vegetables\n\nI'm also a big fan of Georgian lemonades, particularly pear and tarragon flavours.",
      "South Korea / Mexico - Italy in that order.\n\n Jordan was quite good but the food isn't elaborate.\n Peru & Malaysia are great choices as well.\n\n Vietnam was also really excellent but I won't give it top tier because I don't like soup & Vietnam is a lot of soup, also most of their food is hot & why eat hot things in a hot country? But damn it's some of the best soup I've ever had!",
      "Taiwan and Thailand had the best food imo. Absolutely loved visiting the Night markets in Taipei",
      "Real Chinese food from China is so much better than what you get in the west. I had a mystery egg plant and mushroom dish that forever haunts me that I will never eat that again",
      "I was quite surprised how good the food in Bosnia and Herzegovina was. I didn\u2019t go there for a culinary experience, but I certainly did get one!",
      "Portugal- insanely underrated food scene",
      "Thailand.     \nThere\u2019s a reason they essentially invented culinary diplomacy. Their food is so good they use it to create peaceful relations between nations.",
      "Hawaii: Ahi tuna poke bowls\nPortugal: grilled sardinias/olives\nLondon: carbonara at Emilia\u2019s \nParis: bread/cheese\nCosta Rica: pollo de rojo at a local soda \nIceland: cappuccino/ fish cottage cheese/lavabread\nItaly: escargot pasta\nBelgium: fries and mayo\nFlorida: fried chicken and grits and claudie Bs\n\nI know Florida and Hawaii are not countries but I dream about that food still",
      "Iran. Persian food blew my mind \ud83e\udd2f",
      "Korea \n\nOf course Indian (were I spent more than a year in total), Thai (and I mean real family thai food as I was married to a thai and lived there but also from good restaurants), Japanese, Lebanese, Malaysian, Ethiopian food are great, \n\nbut Korean temple food is just way way above anything else I have ever tried. I live next to France and Italy so I don\u2019t even mention those.",
      "I know it's a side track question but for a foodie: What places to avoid, as a vegetarian?",
      "I love Indian food, but while living there for 7 months I was very frequently craving other stuff, mostly Italian and Pan-Asian.\n\nI think my favourites of the countries I've been to (other than my own) are Japanese and Italian food.",
      "Turkey - amazing food.",
      "I\u2019ve visited many places but india can\u2019t be beat in terms of variety and taste in their food items. Each item is so unique and tastes so different. But it tastes good every time lol",
      "I love the food in Spain, France, Greece and Italy.  Also the food in Australia was really good.",
      "from those i have visited definitely turkey, big variety of delicious food for good prices!",
      "Guys trust me, u all need to try Persian food. The tastes will stay with u forever!",
      "France\n\nMajority of restaurants have their unique recipes and take on food. Above that they have a wide range of vegetables, meats, carbs and spices they use. And ofcourse, every meal is made with the perfect preparation  method and technique. There's no matching their perfection and variation.\n\nYou can discover more unique flavors in one region of France than in most countries.\n\nVietnam\nWhile very rice oriented, it was surprisingly diverse in their food and they used rice in ways I haven't seen else where. Restaurants tend to make dishes in their unique way and you can occasionally find unique recipes.",
      "Also a huge fan of Indian food. It's just so varied and diverse depending on where in the country you travel. And as a vegetarian, travelling in India is basically paradise, where in most states I get access to the whole menu rather than just an item or two. \n\nI also have to give a shout-out to some other great cuisines: Italy, Mexico, France, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam. Just to name a few.",
      "I've been all around the world and Malaysia has, hands down, the best street food in the world. I did go to a few sit-down restaurants in the months I was there but the street food was better, cheaper and the scene was more fun.",
      "/#1 the Balkans. Albania, Bosnia, Greece, Turkey, all the ones in between. \n\n/#2 the USA. This is because NYC has every other country\u2019s food scene inside of it. For example, the premier Albanian restaurants will obviously be in Albania / Kosova\u2026 but outside of that, it\u2019s ONLY NYC. I would be shocked if a single Albanian restaurant existed in all of Tokyo, or a single Nigerian restaurant existed in all of Rome. But both and more exist in NYC. Queens is the ultimate food destination on earth, followed by Manhattan and Brooklyn and then Los Angeles. But those foods are largely not NYC in origin. \n\n/#3 Mexico tied with Italy. This depends on your tastes.",
      "I'm Italian, so excluding Italian food, my favourite one is French food. It's variety is incredible, having both oil and butter culture of Europe. I've just spent a long weekend in Paris and I went to 3 different regional restaurants: Corsican, Breton, and Basque. All serving traditional French food, yet none of them serving stereotypical French food. https://www.reddit.com/r/EuropeEats/s/v74KrHIk9R",
      "Turkey has some great food if you avoid the tourist traps",
      "Vietnam, Japan, Spain, France and Italy.\n\nThailand would have been number when I first visited in the 1980\u2019s. But now it\u2019s nearly impossible to find food that isn\u2019t too sweet, isn\u2019t dumbed down for tourists and isn\u2019t just variations on the five curries, the two soups and the three noodles.",
      "Malaysia... I can eat nasi lemak every single day\n\nalso roti jala or roti chanai with curry \n\nand sambal prawns and sambal fish wrapped in banana leaf\n\na close second... Spanish food (catalan food particularly) \npaella\nfidua\nthey way they generally cook seafood\ntheir desserts",
      "Brazilian and Portuguese food",
      "Turkey! Even the food at the bus rest stops is amazing, not to mention the high-end restaurants and home cooked meals",
      "Turkey for me\n\nPerfect balance of spice and flavor, so many different breads and desserts.\n\nWhen flying I always transit through Istanbul only because of the food.",
      "As a vegan, before I lived in the US the US was the best place to visit for food. I also loved India (Nepal is great too). I think in the months I spent in India I only disliked the food I bought at the train station, everything else was delicious. I did get sick a few times though.",
      "Hahaaa, so basically, every country in the world is everyone's favourite. Maybe the question should have been what country has the worst food\ud83d\ude09",
      "The food from countries I already like the food of! With the addition to Indonesian food which was really fucking good.",
      "I am from India, for me I loved the food in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Extended my stay there for one more month cause I liked the food (and everything else about that place as well) so much. It is also quite cheap and healthy, the place is filled with Michelin Guide level restaurants that costs less than 2 dollars most of the time. Loved it.",
      "Japan is probably my favourite but I feel like Spain is very underrated for its food.",
      "Armenia & Georgia. Unexpectedly good, hearty, tasty food.",
      "Indonesia or Malaysian food",
      "Of countries I've been to, Vietnam, Italy, Georgia, Thailand. Cambodia wasn't too bad for the brief time I was there either, still think about lok lak from time to time.  \n  \nIf I can only pick one, Vietnam all the way!\n  \nI haven't been to Japan yet but that's sure to be up there one day as I absolutely love the food!",
      "Pakistan \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf0. It's carnivore Indian food. Very tasty.",
      "Haven\u2019t traveled much yet but for now love Vietnamese food & Nasi Goreng in Bali, also egg coffee in Vietnam, sea food in Goa is also good",
      "Peru is probably the single best food destination that I've been to. It's worth traveling to Lima for the food alone\n\nThailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Korea, Japan, and France were notable too",
      "Loved - Vietnam. Thailand. Singapore. Malaysia. I'm Australian so also love salads etc, basically high quality fruit and veg based dishes with high quality cuts of meat so New Zealand and the Netherlands are both highly enjoyable for me, but essentially the same as at home. I can see why international travellers tend to rate NZ food so highly, while it's not exciting for me, it is very enjoyable and the quality of the produce is amazing. \n\nAmazing but lacked variety - Sri Lanka, Indonesia. \n\nDidn't like - USA, UK, Philippines and Japan. \n\nRegion specific - China varied from fabulous to average by region. \n\nBoring but pleasant - Chile and Cuba. Basically nice meat and veg, but less interesting than Aus/NZ/Netherlands. Some of the steak in Chile was incredible though and home grown pork in Cuba was a totally different taste to what were used to in the west!",
      "I am a Japanese. Hong Kong foods are yummy for Japanese tongue.",
      "Honestly, Asia is the food pinnacle. I'm not Asian but I've travelled quite a bit and pretty much every Asian country has some of the best food you'll ever eat. I don't think I've ever been disappointed with food in Asia. Malaysia, Vietnam, India, Thailand, Japan, Korea, and mainland China etc. I would choose any of these cuisines over my own countries' ones lol",
      "Vietnam ruined all other food for me. Waking up to pho for breakfast, banh mi for lunch, and bun cha for dinner all for less than $10",
      "In no particular order (cause it's impossible) :\n\nSouth Korea, Vietnam, Greece and Italy.\n\nSK and VN for the variety and rich/deep taste of the food. Greece and Italy for that fresh Mediterranean feel, real good match for me.\n\nSpecial mention to Chinese foods which somehow tasted better in other Asian countries than their own country for me, super weird. Like Koreanized Chinese food I could eat almost every day, but in China it was mostly meh. Guess it's not a good match for my palate haha. And of course I heard the taste varies greatly between regions and I've only been to Shanghai so maybe there's that.",
      "Ethiopian food is awesome. Enjoyed every meal. Also lots of vegetarian options",
      "Portugal. Even the non-Portuguese food had so much flavor. Loved everything I ate there.",
      "Absolutely Malaysia, and Mexico. Specifically Penang, and Oaxaca. Each country's perspective food capitols. Insane food in both.",
      "India would have to be up there but its loses some points for the dirtiness which makes it hard to enjoy of of the fresh fruits, juices, and vegetables. Vietnam and Thailand you can pretty much eat anything you see. Still in the top 5, With Thailand, Japan,Vietnam, and Singapore.\n\n\nSingapore is hand down the single best food city and wins by food to county size. No other single location beats it. Every meal was great, you can get food from all over the world and it was all good. and the melding of the different cuisines and cultures. Just amazing",
      "Greece. The food was amazing as the veggies are so fresh and taste soooo good. It is the soil & the climate. Italy is great too.",
      "South Korea\n\nSpain\n\nGermany (but not German food, rather Italian and Greek food there are really good)\n\nJapan",
      "Greece for food\n\n\nThailand for laid back fun vibes\n\n\nAdventure..... Bolivia?\n\n\nBeauty Vietnam\n\n\nI'm going to die Russia",
      "I was pleasantly surprised at the food options in Doha, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the country I enjoyed the most for food. Many immigrants come there to open restaurants and I had amazing sushi, Jordanian, Thai, and Chinese. There\u2019s probably some cuisines I didn\u2019t come across.",
      "Being from New Orleans, it\u2019s tough to find food that beats Home. Japan comes to mind, mainly because of how wonderfully different it was to our world down here.",
      "Iceland felt like a Michelin experience at every restaurant I went. Egypt is another. Food was amazing, Mediterranean food will always be the best in my book.",
      "Thailand. Delicious food and my body just felt *good* during that trip.",
      "Japan\u2026 two reasons: extremely high baseline \u2014 you won\u2019t get a \u2018bad\u2019 meal anywhere. And because they have their own take of your favorite kind of food back home. I had some of the best Indian food ever while in Japan.",
      "Fricken Mexico. Mex city to be exact. Fire street food EVERYWHERE",
      "Turkey \n\nMexico\n\nThailand\n\nIndonesia\n\nGreece\n\nItaly \n\nIn about that order. I love the food in Italy but there\u2019s a higher likelihood of bad or mediocre food when you\u2019re traveling. Greek food is often terrible but when it\u2019s amazing it\u2019s the best. Great Indonesian food is not to be had elsewhere so even though I\u2019ve had a lot of dreadful food in Indonesia, the good food stands out in my memory. \n\nThe first three (Turkey, Mexico, Thailand) are self-explanatory. If I had to choose one cuisine for the rest of my life, it would be Mexican or Turkish. And even though food in Mexico, where I now live, is incredible, the quality of the ingredients - especially vegetables and spices - is second to none in Turkey.",
      "Persian food for me.  Delicious.",
      "Had some amazing food in France.",
      "Oddly enough Iceland has great food!",
      "We are vegetarians from India. Here are our top-10 (other than India) based on the food:  \n1) Nepal (Thakali Thali seals the deal)  \n2) Thailand  \n3) Sri Lanka  \n4) Mexico   \n5) Italy  \n6) Jordan  \n7) Egypt  \n8) Australia  \n9) Uzbekistan  \n10) Turkey",
      "I love Indian food too, but it\u2019s hard to find places that can make non-spicy versions.\n\nTherefore my favourites are probably Singapore, Japan and Italy, but I haven\u2019t been to South-America yet.",
      "Belgium. The people really go out of their way to make everything top notch delicious. I can taste their spirit. Beautiful, honest food!",
      "Sri Lanka - so many good food options. In Europe I would say Greece.",
      "Thailand, but NOT the Thai food. The Thai food itself was mostly over cooked and not too fresh (to Australian taste, anyway). But they had the best Italian and the best Mexican I've ever had. Also the pineapple from street sellers - fresh fruit was wonderful.  And the shaved ice desserts - stuff of dreams.",
      "Kind of cheating but Basque Country, San Sebasti\u00e1n and Bilbao the food is amazing",
      "Indonesia, particularly in Bali! Balinese food is soooo yummy, tasty, spicy!",
      "Armenia.\n\nIt's similar to Turkish food (they claim the Turks just stole their cuisine, which does make some sense) but the spices are better, and they eat pork as well.\n\nTheir beer I wasn't a fan of though, wine and cognac was superb.",
      "Turkey\ud83e\udd79\n\nI love that I didn\u2019t have to carry seasoning with me. The food was perfect.",
      "Peru has the best (raw) food for vegetarians. Not too many options at the restaurants but the food at the market is the tastiest and very cheap which makes no 1 in South America.",
      "South Africa and to be specific the seafood in Capetown",
      "Nepal, probably for similar reasons to why you liked Indian food.",
      "Currently solo hitchhiking through Latin America and I need to admit I love agua panela con queso - Colombia - the food is great everywhere.",
      "India and Italy!!  Can\u2019t go wrong it seems - so much good food everywhere!!  \n\nJapan and Vietnam next!",
      "The levant- I go crazy for lebanese and jordan food. So simple! So filling! So delicious! I remember when I came back home after going  to Jordan I would still have the habit of drinking sweet black tea with bread and hummus every day <3.<",
      "Greece!! I could eat Greek food all day every day.",
      "I must admit I love Indian food but unfortunately it\u2019s the worst food you can eat for your health full of fat cream butter hart attack material",
      "That's a tough one. I guess I'd have to say Turkey? I have Armenian heritage, but the Anatolian kind, so it tastes like the food I grew up eating. Food in Armenia itself is great, but it's not quite the same. (Don't tell other Armenians I said this. They'll murder me.)\n\nEdit: but Turks make awful hummus if they make it at all -- which they usually don't -- whereas I only accept good hummus. That's not an Armenian thing though, that's because my great-grandfather's hometown was near Syria and I grew up eating my great-grandmother's and grandmother's hummus.",
      "India food is like sausages and laws. You don't want to know how it's made.",
      "This is going to sound crazy for anyone who hasn\u2019t been, but Iceland\u2019s food is outstanding\u2026and made even more remarkable by the fact that I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be! They locally source most ingredients. Veggies and fruits are grown in greenhouses, the meat and fish is super fresh and delicious. The dairy\u2026best I\u2019ve ever had (butter, skyr, milk). Every meal we had, whether we ate traditional Icelandic food or not, was excellent!",
      "I've been to around 45 different countries in 4 different continents. I've enjoyed Italy's food the best.",
      "Japan. Japanese food is god tier",
      "Japan, Thailand and China. Loved the fresh food in supermarkets in Italy.",
      "I think Iranian food is super underrated. The way they use fresh herbs & rice, and slow-cooked stews , it\u2019s just next level . Also, we\u2019ve got so many types of bread and little side dishes that bring everything together. If you\u2019re ever in Iran, try the food in Rasht city(north of Iran) \u2014 the place is super green and rich, and you can really feel that in the flavors.",
      "Morocco food is so good",
      "I don\u2019t really care for Korean food,  but the Korean take on western food was so good. Definitely the country where I liked the food the most.",
      "Sofia, Bulgaria has amazing food. I went in without expecting much and totally enjoyed the food here.",
      "Portugal. The seafood,  the meat. All top notch . I had the privileged of living there for 2 years so that might have something to do with it but still traveled other places. And the quality is always up there in comparison",
      "Lebanese and northwestern Spain ( Basque,  Galicia and Asturian food)",
      "I love food in Japan, but real Mexican food in Mexico was so good.",
      "Spain, and it's not close. San Sebastian? Come on. Unreal levels of food there.",
      "I\u2019m surprised no one has mentioned Tunisia! We were there just for their Eid holidays and had some amazing food there. They make certain dishes only on special occasions for example Eid which you won\u2019t find in restaurants. We were hosted by a very hospitable family who introduced us to the type of North African cuisine that we had never experienced before."

One of the largest and best in the country.\n\nHundreds of food vendors all competing to serve the greasiest, fattiest, sugariest goodness to hundreds of thousands of hungry Midwesterners.\n\nIt happens August 25 - September 5.\n\nAnd if you get tired of eating greasy fair food, Minneapolis has a ton of AMAZING restaurants and it punches way above it's weight in terms of it's food scene.",

It\u2019s 5 stars, it\u2019s zero stars. \nPlus transportation is better than most other states, including domestic flights/trains - if that is something that matters. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s such a big market you might even find brand new varieties of all the classic junk food!

NYC would be a great option though because you have lots of places where you can get pizza by the slice, cheap greasy hot dogs, other stuff like that. Tons of options to choose from.\n\nDon't go to the US on an unhealthy food trip without making the time to get fried chicken from Popeyes. My personal favorite guilty pleasure in the country haha. Barely even a guilty pleasure for me, I legit think it's great stuff. NYC has Popeyes so be sure to add it to your itinerary. Also check out Five Guys, a chain for greasy  burgers lol.\n\nAssuming your interest is genuine and this isn't a shitpost, I kind of admire your interests in some ways haha. Some folks travel only interested in the 'high end' fancy fine dining restaurants that, especially in countries with a lot of disparities, are out of reach of many locals and tourists alike. Seeking out the cheap food, the comfort food, the drunk food, and yeah the junk food, means that at least in some cases (not really with Popeyes or Five Guys lol) you'll be supporting the local small businesses that might get skipped over by lots of tourists who are all chasing the top-rated tripadvisor places or whatever. Enjoy your trip, and bring some heartburn meds lol.",
      "I think you should either stick to a southern state or a northern city that has a good sized black community (Chicago and Philadelphia come to mind). Southern food aka soul food is pretty much the pinnacle of our nation's unhealthy cuisine. Luckily it's easy to find in most big cities as well as in every small southern town. Find a historically black neighborhood and there will almost always be a really good soul food restaurant. \n\nAnd southern food not the same thing as barbecue. It's more like fried chicken, collard greens, okra, pork cracklins, chitlins, gizzards. Very salty, very fatty foods that are delicious and classic comfort food. Barbecue is a different thing (although some side dishes like mac & cheese) are part of both traditions).",

Louisville is basically the fried chicken capital of the world. It's also very close to every other greasy food hotspot. Royal hot chicken is a restaurant there and it's amazing. I recommend the deep fried chicken salad balls and Carmel bourbon milkshake. Texas bbq has too many posers to really know where the best stuff is unless you know somebody. I was only there a few weeks. Its really hard to get bad bbq but it's rare to find the life changing stuff. That definitely exists in the south but you could spend your whole life looking and not find it. The secret gem for life changing bbq is Oklahoma. They have unlocked the secrets of bbq but they selfishly keep it to themselves. New York is amazing but not really a great place for greasy food. If you want some solid pizza or next level American Chinese food it's like nothing else in the US. If you like greasy, life changing seafood check out Louisiana. Good people in Louisiana. Minnesota has the best burgers IMO. They have the best cheese and beef in the US. The west coast has some amazing burritos and ramen. Not really a greasy food hotspot though tbh.",

From butter soaked lobster rolls in New England, fried full belly Ipswich clams to delicious heart clogging cracklins in Louisiana and fried chicken and lots in between",
      "You should come during state fair season- usually late summer and fall in the Midwest and South have the biggest/best ones. There you can sample a smorgasbord of absolutely disgustingly delicious food such as deep-fried Oreos/Reese\u2019s cups/butter/etc., funnel cakes, corn dogs, pizza, and cotton candy. They\u2019re also just a lot of fun and an actual culturally American experience.",

Just a few that come to mind:\n\n[Heart Attack Grill](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g45963-d2387669-Reviews-Heart_Attack_Grill-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html)\n\n[Sugar Factory](https://sugarfactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lasvegas_online-compressed-2.pdf)\n\n[Peppermill](https://www.peppermilllasvegas.com/)\n\n[Hash House A GoGo](https://www.hashhouseagogo.com/)",
      "A lot have mentioned NY, and while everyone is meaning NYC, the rest of the state has plenty of garbage or regional items. Rochester is well-known for their Garbage Plates, for example, which would be very fitting. Plus other regional items across the state, like beef on weck, chicken riggies, spiedies, etc.     \nFor a different answer that I haven\u2019t seen yet, Southern California. Can\u2019t beat Southern California weather, and you can get two awesome cities in Los Angeles and San Diego(the latter much better in my opinion). Plenty of garbage items, like hot dogs from Pink\u2019s to pastrami dips at The Hat to San Diego burritos. And Takis are in every store here. Also, it\u2019s 20 minutes away from San Diego is TJ for more awesome food(not necessarily garbage food but it\u2019s not like tacos and other Mexican foods are great for you). And then you will be in the land of Takis.   \nEDIT- and then 2 hours south of Tijuana is Ensenada, which is a great seaside town with fried fish tacos. So for more bang for your buck, Los Angeles, San Diego, Tijuana, and Ensenada. LA to Ensenada is 4 hours(likely much more with LA traffic), but you can take a train from LA to SD, and a trolley from SD to TJ. And there are busses from TJ to Ensenada for around 5-$10 USD. Plus obviously Mexico is a fraction of the price, so your money will last longer",

And the amount of sweet or greasy, wild food is pretty much all down there. \n\nNew Orleans for bomb ass fried foods. Fried green tomatoes, fried catfish/fried shrimp poboys, fried oysters, fried alligator. It\u2019s a must see sorta place. And all the alcohol beverages (in public if you want)that you can think of.

Have fun bring antiacid and some pepto",
      "Go to a state fair if you can! Also all the major cities will have the type of food you're looking for. Especially Chicago IMO, I was eating nothing but greasy food and booze the week I was there.\n\nAlso definitely get some southern BBQ and soul food. It's obviously best if you're in the south, but you can find good quality in all the major cities.",

      "Any state with a Cook Out - it's a fast food chain located in the South. Incredible Southern food for very little money. The amount of food you can get for $5 there doesn't feel legal. My favorites are their hush puppies and bbq plate.",
      "NYC works, but tbh there's so much good food here that it would be kind of a shame if you came and only ate crap. Go to the South and get BBQ, or to a sports town like Philly or Boston and eat bar food.\n\nThat said, if you do come, get yourself a bacon, egg and cheese on a roll for breakfast every single day. Fuck a bagel and cream cheese. And wherever you go, look out for Five Guys (get two patties and Cajun fries). I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.",
      "Your absolute best bet is the South and the Midwest. But you can absolutely find food like that anywhere. \n\nErie, Pennsylvania I remember in particular. I tried to order delivery and half the local restaurant menus looked straight out of Pawnee Indiana.\n\nRochester, NY literally is famous for something called a garbage plate.\n\nIf you're ever in Denver, absolutely hit up the Dog Haus. Their burgers come on 4 little slider buns and they're incredible.",

I'd suggest limiting those portions so you can enjoy a bigger variety... If you wish",

      "Oklahoma. I love it and its people, but I think their primary industry is fast food. And if you head out to the country, *they will feed you* some of the most delicious and deep fried stuff you can imagine. Wander around Nashville too, you can't go wrong.",

I\u2019ve also visited some Balkan cities such as Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo, and the central European cities Prague, Vienna, Budapest. \n\nSo in an ideal world I\u2019m looking for somewhere different to somewhere I\u2019ve been.

      "Tbilisi. Super affordable, really cool, lots of history, old Soviet architecture and modern. Plenty of museums and galleries. Also the most amazing food and wine. They also have 1 year visa-free entry.",
      "San Sebasti\u00e1n is my favorite place I\u2019ve ever been. The food is incredible.",
      "Vilnius!  Often overlooked for Tallinn. Great bars, coffee culture, museums and affordable. Locals definitely seemed more open and friendly than surrounding countries. Food isn\u2019t that great but they have some interesting dishes.",
      "Plovdiv has already been mentioned but I'd definitely recommend it. To me it seemed a much cleaner and relaxed city than Sofia, with some fascinating Roman ruins to explore and loads of cool restaurants, bars and cafes that feel very cheap if you're from Western or Northern Europe.\n\nAlso, have you ever considered Skopje? It's not particularly touristy - although they have jammed the central square with fountains, monuments and shiny statues in recent years - and it's remarkably cheap too. If you like brutalism and Soviet modernism then you'll love the city's concrete heavy architecture but there's also a charming old town with narrow winding streets and open bazaars.\n\nClassic Balkan food (lots of grilled meats, burek pastries and sheep's cheese), the local lager is very drinkable and they also have a lot of the better Bulgarian beers available in shops and bars. Everyone drinks rakia like it's water and like everything else it's remarkably cheap so going out for a session won't break the bank. \n\nIt's actually a fair few years since I last visited but there certainly used to be a great underground music scene with some stonking clubs banging out house and techno. I can't comment on whether that's still the case today however, given how many places have seen their nightlife scene fizzle out over recent years.\n\nIt's also a cool place to visit just because so few people tend to want to go there, so you can impress your friends by having ticked off somewhere none of them have been to!",
      "I am not too sure of the nightlife of these places, but you can consider these:\n\n* Romania: Sibiu, Timisoara\n* Spain: San Sebasti\u00e1n (Donostia), Santander, M\u00e1laga, C\u00f3rdoba, Valencia\n* Estonia: Tallinn (You need to visit this restaurant called \"Porgu\". It is simply amazing.)\n* Slovenia: Ljubljana, Maribor, Ptuj\n* Portugal: Faro, Porto, Lisbon (for the architecture specifically)\n* UK: Brighton\n\nThese are places where I find the food to be generally good and have a soft spot for lol. And some of them are quite quaint and small enough to stroll around and just chill in.",
      "Seville\n\nAmazing food, weather , culture.\n\nAffordable\n\nJust don't go in the middle of summer because its an inferno",
      "Cluj-Napoca in Romania is one of my all time favourites.\n\nPlenty to see and do, people are friendly, food and drink is very cheap with lots of great bars.\nThere's a salt mine not too far from Cluj that has an amazing underground amusement park.  Highly recommend it",
      "Bucharest, the capital of Romania... Nice city, a mix of art dec\u00f2 and communist architecture. Has a vibrant nightlife, very good food and Is dirty cheap. Its also a good starting point to visit Brasov or Peles Castle in Sinaia",
      "Graz in Austria is very underrated. Went there last year with no expectations and loved it. Beautiful architecture, a very good modern art museum, great food and lots of life thanks to the many students. It's overshadowed by Vienna, but I think it's really worth a visit.",
      "Valetta would be my pick. Malta is a highly underrated destination imo. You won't beat the architecture & history (oldest capital in Europe), amazing food, incredibly unique culture and really good club scene. Super easy to get around as well.",
      "I loved Santander, I would pretty much spend the entire weekend in a vermuter\u00eda there. Recently I visited Belfast and it was a surprise. In France less touristic I liked Lyon, Nantes, and Marseille. Looking more east probably Riga and Tbilisi (I did an amazing food tour in Tbilisi).",

      "ko\u0161ice its a university town, after 19th of september there are parties almost every day, many places have live music most of the nights. \nit's not that cheap, but on the main street you can find euro pub ehere every alcohol is for a euro. so a gin tonic for 2\u20ac totally. \n\nArchitecture of the main street is nice especially the gothic style St. Elizabeth church where you can take a look inside, or a tour. At night now after 19:00 you can go to the north tower to take a look at the whole city. \n\nOne of my favourite building is Slavia, where you can have a cafee or food, but bit pricy. \n\nthen the next I would recommend during day to take a look at Hrn\u010diarska street, Zvon\u00e1rska street. One of the most liked food is in restaurant Zvon. \n\nIf you enjoy chocolate than in chocolatery Bon bon you will have an mouthgasm for sure. Everyone who I bring there had one lol. \n\nIf you would like to try out interesting flavours of ice cream try Urban Cafee they make their own flavors, Once I tried Bryndza what is the national food. Its basically sheep cheese. \n \nFor local amazing food I recommend Med Malina on the main street. One that is my favourite food there is pyrohy, which is not our national food, it's Poland's nevertheless Slovak people enjoy that food as well but mostly like a dessert or a sweet meal. \n\nIn the evening, with pals we like to go to Shisha views bar. With very good hookah. \nBut for more chill place for this is Dobr\u00e1 \u010cajov\u0148a on M\u00e4siarska Street, but it is open just until 21:00 but you can buy many asian like souvenirs there and great matcha at least for me. \n\nIf you would like to try out some tea at home, you can buy yourself a few on Hrn\u010diarska where is a tea specialized shop. But the owner is a little dick sometimes. \n\nMaybe an interesting souvenir could be also a book from a Slovak author, that you can buy new at any book shop like Martinus in shopping centre Galeria, Phanta rei-optima and aupark, or you can try a ask in Antiquart on the same street as is the ice cream place. \n\nAnother amazing restaurant with an interesting concept is Ohnisko which is a little more on north. They have... interesting foods. Well try it out yourself you will see. \n\nAnother 2 interesting coffee place that is more unknown is Mal\u00e1 Budape\u0161\u0165(You will love that one that is for sure) and the second one is B\u00f8lge they have the most amazing coffee. \n\nMaybe also I would mention the Easter Slovak Museum as it is a very nice building\n\nAnother bar that comes to mind is New Chicago, its a fun place mostly full. But you have everything there and popcorn as a snack!  Next one is Yama, Bakatu, Jazz club, oh and dont miss out the beer place Dobr\u00e9 \u010dasy, you can ask for appetisers instead of full beer and that way you can try every kind of beer, which is nice. \n\nI am sure there is even more to explore but as someone who lives there just 2 years and dont spent time with exploring, I might not have the complet knowledge of the place. But at least something might help. If you will come here I would always settle for a nice beer!",

      "Marseille in France is an incredible one for me,there is a lot to see and many places to go. Amazing Nature and beach in close distance, a city where you can shy away from the major tourist attractions and get to feel the vibe of the friendly international interesting people living there. A variety of food from different culture on a high level. If you end up going there i can recommend many things :)",
      "Montpellier-such an incredibly pretty city. The food is great and the city centre is just so beautiful. Giant murals the last time I was there. Locals loitering in the square having their meals. I loved it.",

      "Come to Genova! For food genovese pesto, focaccia, other handy stuff. For architectures there are some ancient palace \"rolli\" or many church, big church but a lot lol. (Churches are free to visit). Also the caruggi. Really dark path road made by building built too close. There are also a broken church so its all bombed. You can also can visit corso italia (nice big ass road that follows the coast) and at the end of corso italia there is boccadasse. Really cool place to chill and eat a gelato \n\nBut genova is also mountain. With the public trasportation you quicjly can reach the mountains and see genova from the top and get a nice view.

      "Definitely don't go to India and not eat any Indian food!\n\nIt's a risk, but there are ways to mitigate it. Don't eat raw fruits and vegetables or fresh juices, eat vegetarian where you can, wash your hands well and use hand sanitizer, drink only bottled water. If you must eat non-vegetarian, avoid seafood and beef, as those can be the riskiest- tandoori chicken is probably one of the safer bets because of the super high temperatures of the ovens.\n\nBring medications for it, and oral rehydration salts. Buy a pack of plain biscuits or crackers in case that ends up being all you can stomach until the worst of it passes.\n\nAnd wear a mask if you can-no sense avoiding food poisoning religiously but getting downed by covid instead.",

Most restaurants if not all will have filter water to make their drinks however the ice they add to the drinks comes from another shop that might not have used filtered water to make their ice. \n\nAlso good idea for first day or two to have light snacks and local fruits as this makes your stomach accustomed to the local microflora.\n\nWhen I say fruit, just buy it from a local street vendor or supermarkets, wash it and cut it yourself...avoid buying the pre chopped ones from local street vendors cos who knows how long the cut up fruits been sitting in the sun.",
      "G Adventures is great in India. Did it. Loved it. As for Delhi Belly, my take is you must be a vegetarian in India to limit your chances of being on lockdown for days. I suspect it has more to do with operator error, i.e. the cook and staff, than the food or restaurant from what I've seen and heard.",
      "Ok, so first hand Indian origin experience answer... \n\nTraveling to any new country will absolutely kill your guts..so be prepared with Anitbiotics, antacids...diarrhea medicines, skin infections etc...\n\nThese do not happen because of good hotels or such.. These happen when you're on the road and have to make rest stops... or around town where mosquitos are prevalent or flies on foods, etc... as long as you are in a 5 star hotel, you are fine... but that's not what you are going to India for...\n\nSo go to your GP and get \n\n1. all necessary vaccines(we get some precautionary vaccines before going to india),\n2. Emergency meds with a prescription\n3. Emergency contact(if you can in india/consulate phone numbers)\n4. Multiple copies of travel documents\n5. Send photos or location of yourself to loved ones to keep track of you, once a day minimum\n6. Loose change, don't deal in thousands...try to keep it to hundreds... save money in hotel room\n7. You don't need to old Buddha or Ganesh statues - both are gods, not decorations... Buy a shawl instead?\n8. When sick .. go to a multispeciality hospital ... big ones.. you may lose money, but you will have all that you need there..\n9. In general, to whichever cities you plan to visit... be smart about it...look up their hospitals, emergency guides,.local costs, etc.. have common sense...\n\n10. Ooohhh I almost forgot and had to edit the answer... Mask..the air pollution will reck havoc on the lungs.. so have a mask on when possible..when not have a scarf or bandana...to hold up when passing traffic etc..\n\nMind you we went to india with a 1 year old..  we came back fine...no one sick...and we did not follow much of the above precautions because my family is Indian.. we know our way around..so it's not too bad..enjoy your vacation..",
      "> got sick the first week eating out of a 5 star hotel\n\n> only eat Mcdonalds \n\nNot sure what G-Adventures has to do with any of this.  Despite your contradictory statements, you can get sick literally anywhere, and the tour company doesn't have any specific control over the food you're eating.  \n\nEither be willing to chance getting food poisoning, and bring a z-pack (or 2) with you, or don't go.",
      "I haven\u2019t been on their India tour but I did travel all over SE Asia on a G Adventures tour. They will have restaurant recommendations for every place you visit. No one can guarantee you won\u2019t get sick but they wouldn\u2019t take their tours to any places where there is a history of customers getting sick. That being said, your fears should be the water more than the food. Obviously don\u2019t drink any water that isn\u2019t bottled. Don\u2019t get drinks with ice. And be careful of raw vegetables as they are usually washed with unfiltered water. I got a nasty bug in Peru from a burger with lettuce on it. Pack your antibiotics and enjoy the experience.",
      "I did a geckos tour in India for one week - the company is now defunct but they did similar tours to gadventures. \n\nThere\u2019s no way to totally avoid the rush of food poisoning- and that\u2019s always true, no matter where you go. Go to your doctor and get things to take to help you manage food poisoning symptoms should you get it. Only drink bottled water, and squeeze the bottle before buying to make sure it\u2019s sealed. Brush your teeth with the bottled water too. Don\u2019t buy cut fruit - fruit you have to peel yourself is pretty safe. \n\nDon\u2019t miss out on all the amazing Indian food, it would be such a waste to go to India and only eat McDonald\u2019s. Eat food that\u2019s cooked, hot and fresh. No salads. Eat at places that are busy - their food will turnover fast and not be sitting a long time before being eaten. You can eat vegetarian, there\u2019s plenty of vegetarian options and imo it\u2019s a little lower risk.",
      "I used Intrepid, which is almost the same thing.\n\nNo one got sick, but we only ate at sterile hotel restaurant type places. Part of it is for the food safety, part of it is most of the people on the tours just want alcohol, pizza and burgers, and a rooftop.\n\nSome people did complain that at a cafe, their bottled water cap didn't snap off, meaning they probably took a used bottle and filled it with tap water. Stuff like that happens, there's not a lot of economic opportunity for average people and it causes people to be flexible on morals.\n\nOn my last day, I did a street food tour. Usually it takes a day or two for food poisoning to really hit me. I planned it this way so I was mostly sick at home rather than when I was trying to see the Taj Mahal.\n\nMy general advice is India was an amazing place, but there are places you should visit first that are easier to travel in and have sights that are comparable. If I was only taking one big trip every five years, I would not go to a place where you can smell urine in the alleys and everyone is trying to beg or scam you.",
      "No. No one in our group got food poisoning. Only got a dickie tummy after drinking lol.",
      ">Or, Perhaps to be on the safe side, only eat Mcdonalds or packaged foods like bread and peanut butter?\n\nThe problem with this is, you could still have issues from ice cubes or water.\n\nAsk the tour company how they handle concerns about food.\n\nAnd I would suggest buying bottled water while you're there and using it to brush your teeth as well as for drinking.",
      "I did one of their tours, and yes I did. Within a few days. Not entirely sure but it was either a milkshake or some garlic bread that got me. \n\nThe guides will take you/point you to good restaurants, but you can never be completely sure. I think at least half my group got it at one point.\n\nYour idea isn\u2019t good though. There aren\u2019t many McDonalds there, nor are there pre packaged options.\n\nWhat you should do to be safe is stick to white rice, butter naans, and maybe something else really simple. I personally got a lot of fried noodles. Avoiding meat and vegetables is a solid idea.\n\nIndian food is awesome but it is not all the country has to offer. It\u2019s not worth risking the entire trip and all the beauty of the country just to try the local food. \n\nSounds obvious, but you can get Indian food basically anywhere, while there\u2019s only one place you can see India.",
      "I was in India for 2 months.  And did two G tours there. I am not aware of anyone getting sick.\n\nThe tour guide picks restaurants they know to be safe.\n\n\nDon't drink tap water. Don't eat street food. Wash your hands.\n\nYou will be fine.",
      "If he got sick eating at a 5 star restaurant it's probably because he is not used to eating spices that much on a daily basis. \n\nI'm an Indian living abroad and I also have stomach problems when I go back to India and eat home made food. This usually happens because I don't eat the same amount of spice when I'm abroad and my body cannot process it properly. \n\nMy recommendation would be to gradually eat more spicy food on a daily basis in your home country. Also eat more things which help with the spices like yoghurt, tender coconut when in India.",
      "I have this problem every time I go to a developing country. It's the water that gets you but I think some people are just more sensitive to others. \n\nIf you're only going for a week, take a Pepto every day. It should coat your stomach to prevent getting sick. Don't eat any raw vegetables and try to eat mostly fried food or soups. I've still gotten an upset tummy following these tips but I haven't gotten food poisoning that's taken me out for days. That only happened once and that's when I did more research on how to prevent it.",
      "I didn't use G adventures but Intrepid and only one of us was sick because they had salad (assuming it was washed in local tap water). The rest of us had no issues at all because we are not rabbits. \n\nOn a serious note though I recommend just going for hot freshly cooked food and just to point out the obvious only drink bottled water (also only used bottled water to clean my teeth). I used the cheapest bottle I could find (has a camel \ud83d\udc2a logo) and all was good. The McDonald's is not brilliant there and only serves chicken based products for obvious reasons however it's served a purpose for breakfast in the airport. \n\nDefinitely go to India, just take Imodium with you as a precaution.",
      "I did that exact tour with G Adventures last year. Personally I had no issues (vegetarian, and in India  only drank bottled water, no ice, and ate cooked foods). Out of a group of 13, I think about 4-5 ended up with short-lived stomach troubles, but I don't think any of it was actual food poisoning keeping people down for days, since everyone was able to travel on, take part in all activities etc. \n\nThe guide took us to restaurants that they were sure of and while understandable from food safety standpoint, I would have wanted to eat at some more local places as well.\n\nSo in short - drink only bottled water, don't accept anything with ice or any raw ingredients (salads, veggies etc), no fruit that isn't peeled; ideally mostly vegetarian food, and you'll have a good chance to be fine.",
      "Did a G tour last year and it was fantastic. Couldn\u2019t recommend it enough - our tour guide Jai was amazing and we were with the best bunch of people from all over the world.\n\nSome of us got dodgy tummies but that\u2019s inevitable on any adventure trip, especially to India. Myself and gf were absolutely fine (other than slightly sore after too much spice). One guy got really sick from drinking bad water. But it happens. India\u2019s reputation for Delhi belly is overstated, you can eat food there without getting sick, and G Adventures will definitely take you to reputable places where there\u2019s less risk. \n\nEnjoy!",
      "Unsure if this is entirely relevant, but when I went to India we ate entirely vegetarian which honestly was just as good and removed worry - but at the end of the day overseas food poisoning is just up to chance I find",
      "I went to India on an Intrepid trip earlier this year. I was routinely eating street food as well as food from restaurants picked by the guide (as were several other travellers). None of us got sick. Others ate mainly western food from the restaurants the guide picked and one or two got food poisoning. \n\nThere's no guarantee no matter where you go. I actually think eating food that has been freshly prepared and cooked from scratch is safer than eating western food that's probably been sitting on the shelf for months, but that's me. \n\nJust go and have a good time. Food is an integral part of India's culture, and honestly I don't think you can properly experience the country by only eating 'peanut butter sandwiches'.",
      "Definitely don\u2019t think McDonalds in India is safe. I got food poisoning from McDonalds (as they\u2019ll put raw lettuce etc on your burger). Eat at restaurants but only eat cooked food (nothing raw), don\u2019t drink any water, juice, definitely not ice if you ask for a soda etc. If you stay disciplined there are ways to mitigate it",
      "As an Indian living in delhi the best advice to avoid food poisoning is \n1. Bottled water - look at the brands too like bisleri and aquafina (in some small towns they have fake bisleri and thats just not it)\n\n2. Best places to eat street food is not actually on the street because you dont see a-lot of people using gloves so go to haldirams , bikaner , om sweets etc these are chains of streetfood counters and super safe.\n\n3. If you do ur research you will hundred percent find Amazing food places that are super budget friendly and good .\n4. Sticking to vegetarian is personal choice for some people i don\u2019t really think its much of an issue but avoid beef at all costs the laws regarding beef are iffy and most people frown upon it so you 100% are not. Getting real beef STAY AWAY FROM ANY RED MEAT - most hindus dont consume red meat so it\u2019s quality you cant be sure of. Consume seafood only in coastal areas thats the most fresh seafood you will get! \n5. Be prepared for spices honestly if you want less spicy that means nothing to most chefs so it will still be spicy i would say bring stuff for handling the spice.\n6. If you are travelling among the hills the best thing to eat from the small shops is bread+scrambled eggs they cant premake it so it will be fresh or maggi (yum)\nI think the food variety in india is amazing so if you want any recommendations pm me .\n\nEdit im an international student in canada rn but even when i go back home i never get sick because i stick to my usual choices i have lived in india for well 18 years and not once did i get food poisoning .",
      "Lived in India for 6 months. Was in a small village and then traveled the country tip to tip. Didn\u2019t get sick once. My suggestions - avoid the water. If eating any fruit and veggies that are uncooked - wash them with bottled water. Don\u2019t eat street food. Have your doctor write you a prescription for cipro before going. Have that handy along with pepto, Imodium etc should you get an upset stomach at all. You should be fine. You have to eat the food it\u2019s wonderful!",
      "It\u2019s really going to depend on your body and luck I think. I went for two weeks last year and just ate whatever I wanted including from street vendors and never had a problem. All three times I\u2019ve gone to Vietnam I\u2019ve been much more careful and got sick every time. But it would be a waste of the trip to go to India and only eat McDonald\u2019s. The food is just as delicious as you\u2019re imagining and there\u2019s a much bigger variety of things that aren\u2019t on the usual menus in the US.\n\nI would recommend only drinking bottled water and avoid ice. I also used bottled water for tooth brushing as that seemed to help me in Vietnam.",
      "I've lived there for a year and only got food poisoning once, and I'm pretty sure that was from ice. We sure didn't only eat at McDonald's either. Travelling to India and eating no Indian food sounds depressing. Just do not drink the water. We also ordered our drinks with no ice because that was usually made from tap water.",
      "I was in India for 1 month and got sick twice. The first time eating at a cheap local restaurant, and the second time at a fancy expensive tourist place. It's hard to predict what will get you sick, so don't let it hold you back from eating local food. Bring meds so if you get sick, you can bounce back quickly. It's worth it, even if you have to sit out a couple days with illness.",
      "When I travelled through India I avoided all meat, sticking to a vegetarian diet. No salads as they might be contaminated by washing water. So, only cooked food. Tea to drink or boiled water.",

My friend and I exclusively ate vegetarian and vegan food (including street food) and ended up fine - we didn\u2019t eat any fast food and only limited packaged food. I had a bunch of medication with me as I expected to be unwell but I didn\u2019t need any of it.",

I think the fear of food poisoning was actually worse than any upset from food, which was limited to it being a bit spicy at times. I got more ill from ice in cocktails in Vietnam.  \n\nBeen to India twice. Didn\u2019t get food poisoning either time.",
      "Only one of 7 people got sick during our three week g adventures trip in india. it\u2019s important to add, that it happened with a lassi which was a really bad idea anyway. \nstick to vegetarian food and bottled water, you can decrease the risk of getting sick by a lot. but yeah, it can still happen.",
      "Stomach bugs are water borne diseases. Properly cooked food won't give you stomach bugs because the high temperature kills those virus (I don't guarantee about the after effects of spicy food though). So, even if you're eating at a five star, probably better not to eat raw vegetables or salads, at least not the ones you can't wash. Nobody is at fault here, you just don't have the immunity because you don't live there. And if you somehow catch one of those bacterial ones, ask your host/hotel for hospital support and the hospital will give you antibiotics. It's not expensive, but do take someone local, to help with figuring out everything. Only get bottled water and be careful about allergies. And I believe they sell OTC medicine for stomach bugs too. Keep it with you if you feel insecure. \n\nAlso, there's a reason why Asians wash everything. Do eat fruits but thoroughly wash them. Even fruits that peel.\n\ntl;dr - control your source of water, wash hands/dishes/glasses every time, wash fruits everytime and try to avoid raw vegetables or fruits.",

      "It\u2019s mainly the water not the food. Look for fake bottled water brands with fake names. Buy lots of water bottles from a department store and carry your own water everywhere. Don\u2019t eat non piping hot food that has water outside (juices, milkshakes, pani puri, ice cream from the street, etc). You need to get used to the local microbiome so having local yogurt from a box in a department store might help. Good luck!",

The guide chose pretty much all restaurants and we were warned not to eat street food unless he recommended the vendor.

While it\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly what caused it, we\u2019re pretty sure it was a restaurant we at ourselves, not one of the group  restaurants. But on every G adventures trip I\u2019ve been on, there\u2019s always somebody who gets sick (food poisoning or otherwise). When different people from all over the world hang out together in a county that\u2019s foreign to all of them for extended periods of time, it\u2019s highly likely that someone is going to pick up some big their body isn\u2019t used to. I would never let the prospect of food poisoning put me off going anywhere because then you\u2019d never be able to go anywhere. You can get food poisoning from anywhere , even your own kitchen.",
      "Was literally looking at G adventure trips to India today and was wondering about food too\u2026 spooky.",
      "I went with Intrepid. We had some fabulous meals but yes more than one person got food poisoned. I got violently ill from eating from a street food vendor in Pushkar that the tour guide swore up and down was totally safe and had never made anyone sick. And i was also the only one to get sick from it so go figure. I looked the cart up and down and it did in fact look relatively clean, and the food was vegetarian and hot and fresh and cooked. So who knows. My friend got sick from the hotel breakfast in Delhi, and we'd eaten like four or five meals there that were fine before that happened.\n\nDO NOT waste the trip eating McDonalds. Indian food is incredible. On my trip, many of the activities and experiences were not as fun as i hoped, but the food was usually better than i expected. Remember you are still likely to get food poisoning from a Ritz cracker because you ate it after touching a menu or your phone or a doorknob and then touched the cracker. You may as well eat something better than a damn Ritz cracker.\n\nOn this trip we took all possible precautions, didn't eat anything that seemed risky, hand sanitized often, only ate piping hot fresh food from good restaurants, and we still got sick. BUT i also had some of the best tasting meals of my entire life that I'll remember forever. Just accept that this is a high risk high reward scenario. Literally one of the best reasons to go to India and the best parts of the experience is the food, don't waste this opportunity because of fear unless you have a pre-existing medical condition that makes it super dangerous for you.\n\nALSO note that drinking hard liquor after a risky meal cuts the chances of food poisoning significantly. Do some research on that. (You will not have access to liquor at all places in India so this doesn't help that much.)",

All of the restaurants we ate at were chosen by the guide to make sure none of us got sick, he even found a place that I could get Pani Puri that use filtered water so it was safe! I would 100% recommend, just maybe skip the fast food chicken burger!!",

If you eat any raw fruits or vegetables make sure it is thoroughly cleaned with boiled water not top water.  Avoid juices. Vegetables are popular in a lot of street foods -only eat it if it\u2019s cooked. I got horrible food poisoning from a sweet potato dish once, the toppings were chutneys,and chopped veggies. I\u2019d avoid any North Indian or Indo Chinese food.  Stick to South Indian - it\u2019s at least fermented and much lighter.

Possibly the airport in Mumbai (no citpro- miserable flight home), and from a smoothie in a mall food court (citpro and survived a 2 hour train ride with no bathroom)."

      "Make a note so you have your next trip planned. Food is one of the reasons I love to travel so I always make a note of interesting ideas, or smells even if I never go back.",
      "I had never really thought of it, I tend to eat what I want and enjoy it.   But, towards that end, that's why I like buffets. Because I can have a little bit of everything.  This is especially true for Indian food.  There's so much Indian food I like, just ordering one meal but not work.",
      "Not really. Depends on the person, I often miss all the amazing food because I completely forgot it exists once I set my foot outside the airport. But I know I will be back again someday so I don't really regret it.",
      "Yes!!  I am solo traveling Thailand right now and i feel like this.  With food so inexpensive I could order 3 to 5 dishes but feel bad because most would go to waste.",
      "It is a negative for sure, biggest issue in communal/shaeing food countries. But I am also happy that i cna whatever I'd like to without the headaches of comprises with travel buddies.",
      "Yes, or even an appetizer would be nice, but it's too much food.\n\nIndian restaurants annoy me. At least the ones I've been to in SE Asia. Every dish is too much for one person and it never comes with rice. So I have to order an entree for two or three people just to have a meal plus a ridiculous amount of rice. Last time the server was like \"are you sure you want this much rice?\" I was like no, can I have a smaller one and she said it didn't come smaller. It was like she couldn't wrap her brain around the problem. \n\nDo they not understand a person being alone?",
      "Sometimes I get the big item anyway and bring back the leftovers. Assuming there\u2019s a fridge and a way to reheat.  But yea, if it\u2019s something that\u2019s communal and expensive I sometimes wonder if there\u2019d be someone in the hostel who\u2019d go with me but nah, hostel staying people aren\u2019t going to want to spend much on food. \u2026Anyone else out there goes all out on food but saves on accommodation?",
      "Yes so do food tour \n\nOr eat several smaller meals throughout the day to try more places",
      "I was so sad while traveling through China years ago. I wanted to try Peking duck but my sister, with whom I was traveling, is vegetarian. Terrible foodie travel partner.",
      "No. I love to try new foods but asides from a bite off of a friend\u2019s plate, with the exception of a romantic meal, I usually prefer to have my own dish. \n\nMy solution is to try what I want to the most. If there is something I wasn\u2019t able to try, I will try to find it back home (I live in NYC so it\u2019s possible for many cuisines) or if it\u2019s not insanely complex I may just cook it myself.",
      "No because self-control and moderation prohibits me from suffering food commas. If i did want to sample everything, i would simply order it and not finish it.",
      "I totally get that! It can be tough when you want to try everything on the menu but are solo. One hack I\u2019ve tried is eating at the bar\u2014sometimes bartenders are open to splitting plates. Or, you can ask for half portions of a few dishes. Any luck meeting fellow foodies on your travels? I\u2019ve found that connecting with others who love to share meals makes it more fun!",
      "Its the only thing I'm sad about,  but I just end up making friends with strangers and sharing food. Or I'll order more and bring leftovers home. We chose this life so we can't complain about it \ud83e\udd72",
      "This is the one big thing I miss when I solo travel. However, I'm lucky enough that I'm from an area with a lot of great choices food wise, which lets me focus on trying things that are unique to a travel destination.",
      "No, because there are options to do that solo. Besides food tours, there are tapas, dim sum...but also, I hate when I'm out with others and all they want to do is share each other's food. I want to enjoy my food without someone else touching it. I also have dietary restrictions that make that complicated and I end up not getting enough to eat. I prefer getting to order what I want without having to consult others.",
      "No, never. Food is a key element when I travel, I do a lot of planning around it, and this helps in diversifying what to eat. Eg at the end of the month I'm going to Bologna and I will organise the meals in a way to try the different food, like having a list of dish to try. Then you can always join a food tour, I have even done multi-days food tours, 7+ days long. The only limit I sometimes experience is when a dish must be ordered by 2+ people, but I always ask if they can accommodate for a single portion (eg if a risotto is for 2+, the waiter can check with the kitchen and put my order together with another table). This year I spent a long weekend in Lisbon and I tried 5 of the top 12 past\u00e9is, including the winner, so travel solo is definitely not a limit :-D",
      "90% of the time I hate family style meals because the thing I really want, I only get a bit of and then have to eat their silly choices. But I understand the appeal.\n\nThat being said, I'm all about food when traveling and have found street food to be great sizes so I can visit 5 or more places in a day. Walking instead of cars helps make room for more food. I also carry a Ziploc so I can get stuff for later to enjoy in a park or something. If you're wealthy enough, you can also order multiple dishes and take leftovers to a homeless person.",
      "I love doing a food tour. I get to meet a few people, try lots of things, and usually go to places I wouldn't have found on my own.",
      "I'm very mad that I can't get a Rijstaffel for myself. \n\nFood tours do help, though.",
      "No I\u2019m never sad that I can\u2019t share food with a travel mate when I travel solo because I absolutely hate sharing food. I order exactly what I want and I\u2019m gonna eat the whole portion. I spend a month in each country I visit so I always have enough time to try every dish I\u2019m interested in. No need to share (I hate sharing food).",
      "I'm the opposite, I'm so glad to not have to share my food with anyone! I'll still order (well maybe not 10 plates, but) 4 plates and take the rest home.",
      "Me! Some of the good food have large serving!  I\u2019m not a fan of food tour :(",
      "Food tours, totally!",
      "I once did a Nagomi visit in Japan. I was matched with a family and went to their home for a meal. It was a great way to try homemade food and meet people.",
      "I'm 5 stone overweight. I sample more than enough food \ud83d\ude16",
      "If you\u2019re traveling to countries that have street food or markets, go to a busy area and get something small from a bunch of different stalls. I used to love doing this in Japan and Thailand and it was a good way to try lots of things. If you\u2019re not too concerned about money/food waste just order a bunch of things and eat a little bit of each. You could ask for the rest of it to go so as not to offend the staff and then eat it later if your hotel has a fridge or just throw it out.",
      "Food isn\u2019t really primarily the reason I travel (or even think about) and plus I have self imposed dietary restrictions. I do go to eat at highly rated places but I\u2019m also on a budget so I don\u2019t go fancy much. I\u2019m also more of a \u2018cook my own meals\u2019 guy to be honest. That way I can stay healthy, not break the bank and still feel satiated and ready for whatever adventure comes.",
      "Big time.  Descend into the basement of a Japan department store and gaze longingly at all the savory and sweet foodstuffs that you have to stomach budget, alongside the thousands and thousands of other restos you'll see on your trip."

    "selftext": "This is gonna be like a rant but it\u2019s just my observation, no bad intentions.\n\nI\u2019ve been saving money and planning my first big solo trip, so in this time I\u2019ve followed a few content creators in my age group.\n\nBut one after another, it feels like they are greatly exaggerating their means of travel. I followed 3 girls who have traveled since they were 18/19 years old. So naturally people are asking how they can afford it. Every one has basically the same story-they saved up and now are making some money online like TikTok. One girl is from Austria that doesn\u2019t have a Creators Fund, but she does \u201cphotography\u201d (which seemed a bit weird cuz how exactly are you making money with photography on the road?). Mind you, this girls Plan A before traveling was to study in NYU. I think this already explains her families financial situation.\n\nBut then EVERY TIME they go home, they return to a fancy house. The Austrian girl went home because she \u201cmissed her horses\u201d.\n\nAfter that I started questioning how actually self sufficient these really young travelers are. Especially the Austrian girl who doesn\u2019t make money from TikTok, yet goes on expensive trips like Papua New Guinea.\n\nIdk they just started to feel much less relatable. I think being able to work and not spend a cent to save up for travel is a privilige in itself.  The only solo travel creators who seem actually self sufficient are the ones who are 24+ and explicitly say that they have a remote job/business, or have pretty big social media. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this?\n\nEdit: I think a lot of people in the comments think I\u2019m talking about succesful YouTubers who make polished videos with crazy experiences and food tours. I am talking about TikTokers with 100k followers who post vlog style videos and also share the nitty gritty details of budget travel.\n\nOne thing I realised what explains my observation is that a lot of upper middle class like to hide the fact and cosplay as poor- because their class makes them lose authenticity and relatability, and fear of judgement.

      "Stop watching them, it's unrealistic.\n\nI live in hotels, 320+ nights a year for about 10 years now across the world. If anyone gets \"upgrades,\" it's  me and travel about as good as you can until getting into all the private, super exclusive stuff which is a club we aren't in.\n\nTo answer your question, YES, they leave that part out along with some of these trips being complimentary due to their follower base. Most of these videos are paid advertisements to show of certain aspects a specific airline like seats on a plane, lounges, food, etc.\n\nDon't underestimate how much these influencers make. Some have teams of people setting this stuff for them. Others are solo rich kids who just hire a film crew to follow them around.",
      "Everywhere I travel, I see young people with ring lights, doing weird dances and just talking to their phones as they walk along a beach or tourist area. What I never see is them stay for more than 10-15 min. They bring a huge bag, change, look like they plan on staying all day and then \u201c poof\u201d they are gone just as fast as they came. No expensive beach drinks or food, no expensive poolside bar service. I once even heard a couple complaint that a bell boy let an influencer into a room they had reserved and was coming out as they were going to enter, the place looked disheveled. The hotel insisted it had been occupied by a previous person the night before and cleaned properly before their stay. I\u2019m pretty sure the hotel worker let them into the $4k a night room for a quick photo shoot but got caught before he could remake the bed and cleaned properly . I doubt they actually stay at these high end places.",
      "I don't work in social media but I did start solo traveling at 14-15 from my own money. Did part time work after school/college & on weekends. I was one of the assistants for an event company (concerts, exhibitions etc). \n\nObvi I didn't do luxury travel back then but it was enough to afford budget airplanes, small boutique hotels/homestays, street food, motorcyle rental/metro pass",
      "Short answer : yes.\n\nI'm sorry but if you are not, you can't afford to go travelling at 18. \nI do not come from wealth, \"just\" always had a roof over my head, food on my plate and some vacations at my family members place. So compared to I think 2/3 of people on this planet, I'm rich. Yet at 18 I had barely 1500e in savings which does not make for travelling on an extended period. And I needed them to pay for extra costs for university. I could never work before being 18, only places hiring were out if my reach (no personal vehicle and 30km away).\n\nHaving enough to go alone on holidays at 18 means your family gave you money on a saving account for part of your life already. Or you worked and saved it all, meaning your family could provide for you totally during this time. This is being rich. Okay, not extremely rich maybe but still !",
      "Even if you travel as cheaply as possible, expenses are still around 40 euros a day (including transportation, food, and hostels).\n\n40 euros!!!\n\nHowever, it is possible to travel through volunteering. If you can, I highly recommend it!",
      "A friend iis, he's a writer and most of his trips are sponsored so he can write about them. He started as a food reviewer, then would review foods while on vacations, then magazines started contacting him to go to specific places to try things (hotles, resots, restauarantrs, etc)",
      "Yea it is unrealistic. I'm 34 and it took me until I was about 31 to be financially stable enough to start traveling. But if you look for deals, travel during the off seasons (winter) and use Google flights and airbnb its actually quite affordable. \nIn the past 3 years I have been to 17 countries. Each trip being about 7 days and averaging about 1300 for airfare and lodging. \nFor me the trick is to book my tickets about 6 months in advance. Save up and pay half of the airbnb then just slowly pay off the rest, by the time the trip date comes you've already paid for everything, you just need money for food/shopping/public transportation on ur trip. Doing it this way makes it cheap and low stress. \n\nFor reference, I make about 72k usd per year. So it's not like I'm wealthy, just a normal working class dude who prioritizes world travel."

      "I'm omnivorous and will eat almost everything/anything but prefer to sample whatever the locals are eating.  There's usually a very good reason why the local favourites are the favourites. For me, I see mealtimes as another way of exploring the local culture of wherever I'm travelling, similar to any other tourist site, cultural event, or attraction.\n\nMy go-to is to search for street food and food halls. Food halls are especially good as these tend to have people milling about at all times so no one notices if you're hanging around for a couple of hours, there's lots of variety, and you can check out what others are eating without seeming too weird.\n\nIf the weather allows for it, I'll sometimes grab some groceries or a variety of nibbles from a market and have a little picnic with a scenic view or people-watch.\n\nThe worst is when you're hangry but don't know what you want because your blood sugar level is too low to make a decision!",
      "I\u2019m obsessed by food when I travel, and sometimes craft my itinerary around a particular meal, for example stopping in Singapore to eat at Banana Leaf Apolo or choosing a hotel in Paris\u2019s 10th to be close to Du Pain et des Id\u00e9es bakery. I find Instagram is helpful. I also make reservations at high demand places.",
      "Whenever you're hungry, Google 'food near me', set it to 'top-rated' and 'within 1km' and see what it brings up. Very rarely will you not find something half decent in a place like Spain doing this.",
      "Personally I get a lot of anxiety sometimes with the language barrier. Sometimes I'm ready to take it head-on, other days I dread it. On those days I either go to a grocery store with a self-checkout or use Uber eats. \n\nOn that note... can't hurt to hit the grocery store either way and just keep food on hand. You don't always have to eat the local cuisine. Sometimes a frozen pizza or a cheeseburger from McDonalds is fine. Don't beat yourself up about it.\n\n**edit**\n\nUber is also great because you can sort by rating (they give a special badge to the highest rated places) and they even show you what the most commonly ordered items are. It tends to cost a tad more than going in person but you can just use the app to find the places, then actually go to them yourself. You can also pay for Uber premium which saves you a bunch of money if you use it at least a couple times per month",
      "Honestly, my food problem when I travel is usually just that I need a second stomach to even contemplate eating everything I would like to.\n\nI do advance research and pin places I'd like to eat in Google maps. I might make a reservation or two and then I have the rest of the options as places I can pull up easily when I'm hungry and want to know what's good nearby.\n\nHowever, that's obviously not your thing. So why don't you self cater? Depending on your travel style in Spain you could Air BnB, stay in a hostel, or stay in a guest house and have access to a kitchen. If I'm somewhere for a week or so, I'll generally end up making some of my own meals. Going to local food markets is always fun for me. But you can also just head to Lidl and get some cheap options. \n\nPlus, you don't have to buy into the local food culture unless you're in a really small town. In a city, there'll always be different options open throughout the day, including cuisines from other cultures. I just had fantastic Lebanese food from a deli in Paris. I don't often go somewhere and only eat the stereotypical local dishes.",
      "In Spain, I like to have something light for breakfast - cafe con leche and a roll or maybe some toast with tomato and oil.  Then for lunch, have a full meal - menu del dia is offered at lunch time in many restaurants and is usually a starter, a main course and a dessert.  You typically have a choice for each course and restaurants will often have their menu posted outside so you can see what they are offering. And it is usually pretty economical - you can get some nice food for not a lot of money.  Then for dinner, I'll have something lighter like tapas - in many bars, they will give you small tapas with the drinks you order, but you can also order something specific - racciones - slightly larger portions and there is more variety.  You can order one and keep it light or order more to make for a more filling meal.  I like to do this because I am not generally a big eater and eating a full meal late isn't great for me.  \n\nIn general though, I usually scope out some good prospects for meals ahead of time and pin them on Google Maps.  I'll look up articles about what a place is specifically known for and what restaurants are recommended for that thing - definitely tag those.  Then, when I get someplace, I have some pre-selected options if I want - or I can wing it.",
      "Girl, you're in SPAIN and you're struggling to eat?  If you're eating PB&Js.. you're beyond hope.  The spanish start the day light with coffee and maybe a pastry, then eat little meals over the day until a long late dinner.  They perfected tapas for this reason - pop into literally any bar and you'll get a little snack too, and they have larger food options too.  There are so many options there's no way you're sick of them in one week.  I could live off tapas.  Most restaurants have lots of smaller dishes too and it's no problem just to eat and run.  Google maps is all you need and I will plan daily trips around a place I especially want to go to.  Esp as a single it's very easy to get into a popular place if you come early and promise to leave soon.",
      "Ohhhh girl, I plan entire trips around food. Researching all of this stuff is fun for me though, so I completely understand it can be daunting or uninteresting for others. I think for my upcoming trip to Paris (which is only 6 days), I have over 100 places on my to try list. Just an excuse to come back I suppose :)",
      "So food isn't super important to me when traveling because I am pretty picky. I've been leaning vegetarian for the last year or so. I search for vegan restaurants because it's more likely not to have a random meat slipped in because fish flakes or ham is like salt and pepper in some countries. If that fails I look for a pizzeria, grocery store or corner store for something I know I can eat. It may not be super exciting but I don't care as it works for me. As for people who will say I am missing out I'm not I always find a new fruit or other new food I have never tried before when I travel internationally.",
      "Spain is always tough for me, because I tend to get indigestion if I eat later than about 8pm! They\u2019re not even thinking about dinner by then LOL \n\nWhat I generally do there is adjust my food intake so that my evening meal is very light, and my biggest meal is the afternoon one. I\u2019m often the first diner in a place in the evening. \n\nAre you staying in a hotel, hostel, Airbnb?",
      "This might be unpopular, but don\u2019t make yourself eat the local food if you\u2019re tired of it. I spent 3 weeks in Spain last summer. 2 weeks on the Camino where it was the same bocadillo and papas EVERY single day. When I finished with that section of the Camino, I ate Asian food in Barcelona for a week. Sushi, Korean noodles, ramen. I felt guilty for not having tapas and sangria everyday, but travel is about enjoying your time and your food. Get some Italian or Mexican or burgers in Spain if you\u2019re craving it!",
      "I really love food so it never feels like work for me or anything that I feel like I'm going out of the way to plan. \n\nI often have a list of restaurants before I even leave that I want to try. I talk to hotel staff and locals who work in touristy areas where to go. Every country has a national dish, and it's usually something that's universally liked, but you can find lists by country that showcase other, lesser known dishes that will likely interest you.",
      "I\u2019m one of those people that prioritizes food on trips. This is how I usually do my planning:\n\n1. Make a list of all the dishes I want to try of the place I\u2019m going to.\n2. Research the best restaurants serving each of those dishes and look up if I need to make a reservation. Some restaurants might open up reservations on a specific day or do walk in only with a line outside, so I make a note of that.\n3. Figure out where each of those restaurants are on a map.\n4. Plan out my days based on restaurant locations. Ex. If there are two restaurants I want to go to in nearby neighborhoods, I might go to one for lunch, explore the surrounding neighborhood/find attractions near there, and then head to over to the neighborhood of the other restaurant closer to dinner.\n5. Make the actual reservations if needed once I have the days figured out.\n\nI also splurge on a few fancy meals while on vacation, but this is dependent on your budget. In this case, I\u2019ll look up the most famous fine dining restaurants in the city and gauge the reviews to see if it\u2019s worth it. The famous ones usually book up months in advance, so looking up reservation timelines for them is one of the first things I do after deciding I\u2019m going to travel somewhere.\n\nPeople might think this is a lot of work for food, but I\u2019m always disappointed when I don\u2019t plan ahead and wander into places. There are lots of places where other people claim you can just go into any restaurant and it will still be good (ex. Japan), but I found the food to be pretty mediocre compared to what I\u2019m used to whenever I did that. I have lots of really good food options near my home, and I want to guarantee that the food I\u2019m eating while traveling is at least better than what I can already get on a regular basis.",
      "I usually try to limit \"sit-down meals\" to one per day. Which usually means having a very big lunch or a big dinner. And the other meals more lighter.\n\nFor example, some cereal/yoghurt for breakfast in the hotel/airbnb/hostel, a big lunch at a local restaurant then a very light meal for dinner (usually from a shop or fast food place).",
      "Spain is one of the easiest places to find a variety of food. It's easy to eat when you want too, if you don't mind eating at a bar.",
      "I despise the food aspect of travel. It's stressful, expensive, and takes a long time. In my ideal world I'd eat out at most once a day. We've tried booking accommodations with a kitchenette which has helped a lot with this issue.",
      "Oh my god I still remember people looking at me like I have two heads when I asked where I can go to dinner at 730 in Barcelona. \"Why do early?!\"\n\nI do a lot of research and usually have a list of 15-20 restaurants I want to go and mark them on a map. If they don't require reservations, I go about my day and head into any of them on the map if I'm nearby when I'm hungry. \n\nI feel like most people that struggle with food on vacation just have to be picky eaters. I look forward to trying things I've never had or just asking the chef to make me whatever his must-try thing is\n\nWith that in mind, you're in SPAIN, home of some of the best food on the planet. Maybe if you were somewhere that isn't so mainstream culturaly I'd understand but I can't think of things on a Spanish menu that wouldn't appeal to most people. Some of it is adventurous but most of it is just patatas bravas and paella and ham",
      "Hi there! I love food and don't mind eating alone, at home or traveling. 39F.\n\nI don't do 3 meals + take my iPad.\n\nI usually do: (if eating out is not so expensive)\n\nHotel breakfast (large), an informal cake + tea or a snack at lunchtime/in the afternoon (caf\u00e9, food court, street, museum caf\u00e9). Eating out in the evening OR buying sushi for the hotel. \n\nIf dinner is expensive (Scandinavia) I stay in an Airbnb and do a light toast and joghurt breakfast myself, then a lunch menu/lunch buffet lunch (large). Cake/snack in the afternoon + cold dinner (sushi, sandwiches, eggs, salad...) In the Airbnb. And no alcohol. \n\nI don't like to find 3 places to eat/or get food from per day. So breakfast is wherever I'm staying (both scenarios) and only one warm meal out.\n\nMany of these can be eaten at different times, street food is often there at any hour. An Airbnb or Hotel minibar let's you have cold items to eat. I often buy fruit (I travel by train and can take a small kitchen knife with me). Buy local m\u00fcesli bars, supplement with sandwiches and fruit/veggies.",
      "Food can cause me a lot of stress when traveling. One thing that helps is clearly deciding that travel is for me and every meal doesn't need to be special and unique. I make good use of grocery store sandwiches and the like, I'll go back to a restaurant if it was easy and good enough, and the only times I've ever stepped into a McDonald's in the past 5 years have all been while traveling when I just couldn't deal with restaurant paralysis. In Japan, I used google maps reviews and searched for \"English menu\" and \"tablet\" to make it easier for myself to choose a restaurant.\n\nI like food and had a long list of foods to try on my last trip - but I'll never be the person with a slate of reservations for amazing well-reviewed restaurants and that's ok.",
      "I google (search or maps) best restaurants in <add location> & go from there. Some places are easier than others ( currently in Ubud where you can throw a stick in any direction and hit amazing food). Do it a few times and you get good at it and it becomes fun not to mention delicious.",
      "I love tapas and still found Spain to be very stressful. Sometimes it was hard to find sit down places to eat and I was so stressed having to navigate bars to get my food every night! You could get food at a grocery store and make some meals for yourself if that\u2019s something that feels more comfortable",
      "I love trying new foods when traveling so I plan for it, just like many travelers would plan their itinerary for tours, museums, attractions, and so on. \n\nSo that means planning ahead for what I want to try and where to get it. I also try to book a few highlight restaurants for memorable lunches or dinners, knowing that the best places can be full or very busy during high season or on weekends or holidays. \n\nI'm not a big breakfast eater so I'm pretty happy with a coffee and pastry or piece of fruit, or a continental breakfast if staying at a hotel. I usually look for cheap and cheerful lunches near the places we are visiting that day, scouted the night before using Google Maps and reviews. In some places, like Spain, it's the reverse because I can't eat that late either, so it's a bigger lunch and then a light dinner at what looks to the locals like a ridiculously early time.",
      "Here's how I did when I went to Italy this summer as an example.\nAbout a year ahead I'll check the top restaurants of the country, some need to be booked that far ahead and I love fine dining. \n\nI use chat gpt and search for what is the typical local food and then search that on Google and see what places look like I'd enjoy. I have a pretty good eye for that so I can tell from pictures on Google or Instagram If I'll like it.\n\nI read different lists of best \"30 restaurants in Milan\" and again will go through seeing what I think I'd like\n\nEvery place I think I'll like I save on Google maps on a list. So that if I'm walking around and get hungry I can look at the map and see what's nearby. \n\nAsk locals, if you go into a store, take Uber or taxi or strike a conversation with a local I always ask what their favorite restaurant is. \n\nI'll look for what the biggest groups of immigrants in that area is and you can usually have some great food. Italian and Japanese food in Sao Paulo Brazil for example. \n\nI personally try to stick to the typical local food as much as possible cause I can get other things at home usually. \n\nSome of my days are booked around food some are not and I'll just check the map or walk by a place that looks good and check the menu",
      ">a girl can only eat so many bocadillo ibericos and tapas.\n\nFor me, this is false, lol.   \nBut the answer is Google maps, or a hotel concierge. If the local restaurants are closed at a given time, try grocery stores or international foods. Indian food, Chinese food, or kebab shops might still be open during siesta.   \n\n\nI used to work nights, getting a big snack around 3pm should hold you over to 8. And if you need a hamburger at a tourist trap, no judgement. Bookmark somewhere easy as a fallback plan.",
      "Don\u2019t overthink it. It\u2019ll entirely depend on budget, but more importantly just go with the flow.\n\n I\u2019ll usually just take a walk in the morning until I find a nice coffee shop with attractive pastries \u2014 look for crowds. Pop in to a grocery store for lunch. They will usually have fresh sandwiches, fruit, meats and cheeses, grab a bottle of wine and go sit at a park or beach. For dinner, again, just take a walk and look for a nice spot. It might be hit or miss, but that\u2019s travel. If you\u2019re interested in a specific cuisine, restaurant, or neighborhood \u2014 utilize Reddit! There are food and restaurant threads where you can look up whatever city you\u2019re in and find great recommendations from locals! \n\nGood luck, and just have fun.",
      "Trying new foods is part of what I love about traveling, but I struggled in Spain. I had a lot of issues getting a table at a real restaurant (I.e. not fast food or western food). I don\u2019t drink and they didn\u2019t want me to sit at the bar unless I ordered a minimum amount of alcohol, plus my eating schedule is different from that culture and I can\u2019t eat so late.  All of this to say, I thought Spain would be easy but it\u2019s the only country I\u2019ve had issues eating what I wanted when I wanted it.",
      "Food is probably the biggest reason I travel. \nI look up places beforehand, read reviews... know where I want to eat and what I want to eat...basically my whole days are planned around food, having food, thinking about the food, remembering the food....\nIt's so great.",
      "I just came back from Japan, and I did a lot of research on food before I went, specifically on things I could buy on the go, at conbinis, or at chain restaurants. I tend to get hungry a lot when traveling so I wanted some quick options for when I was tired, in addition to actual restaurants. It helped a lot, both in knowledge of what I could eat, but also in what my expectations should be. (Also, I wish Canadian convenience stores had better food selection like Japan!)",
      "When I was in CDMX, I was surrounded by lots of food options, at the two week point, 7-11 cup noodles and hostel restaurant were my go-to's.\n\nThe guy who owned the hostel when I was in Quebec city also owned a cafe next door and I'd eat there nearly every other meal for snacks, full meals etc. near the end of my trip.\n\nHonestly, it's finding a comfortable spot and just having food there without worrying about missing out on something. Comfort foods towards the end of the trip were the way to go for me.",
      "I\u2019m with you\u2026. I was Tapa\u2019d out. I didn\u2019t want to eat it anymore nor have paella. Eating at weird hours also caused indigestion as well and I did eat light but sometimes found myself starving late at night. What I did was look for other cuisines or dishes to break up the monotony\u2026 I succumbed and ended up having pho one day. Lol. I\u2019m a foodie and I love to eat and try new things. Yeah I was not jamming with jambon and had to tap out on tapas",
      "As I've gotten older, I've found that I can only stomach so much restaurant food in so much time. 3-4 days I'm usually fine but around 5 days or so, it starts to wear on my stomach and my wallet.\n\nSo if at all possible, I like to at least eat something and caffeinate before I walk out the door. Just puts me in a better mood. Domestic US I grab some plain cereal  and yogurt and some canned or bottled iced coffee. I adjust as needed abroad. \n\nI try not to plan out my meals too much in advance. If I'm in a high tourist area in tourist season then yeah I'll make dinner reservations but generally I just pull up Google Maps and see what is good.\n\nMeal times I just roll with it. I actually like how the Spanish do it for lunch. you can get a good, filling lunch during their lunch time for a solid price. I don't love their later dinner hours. Restaurants may still be open at 7, you'll just be the weird tourist dining in an empty restaurant. \n\nAnd not every meal is going to be \"an experience\". I actually like trying out fast food and regional chains both domestically and abroad. I did Dion's when I was traveling New Mexico and ended up really liking it.  Best damn pizza of my life? No, but it was a solid middle-of-the-road pizza that the locals love for a good price.",
      "Spain has got the most limiting food choices of all the countries I have been to, and part of the reason it was also my least favorite. Rough for a vegetarian.",
      "Can't blame you Spanish food is bland AF",
      "I very rarely change my eating schedule to suit the country I\u2019m in- it just messes me up too much. If culture considerations get in the way, Ill still join people at the meal but just take a couple bites and socialize. Breakfast is my most important meal so selecting lodging with a free, substantial breakfast is must. Snack during day and stop at grocery stores as needed (or follow people for a couple bites of lunch if I\u2019m obligated), and an early dinner- usually at a restaurant. \n\nFor me, it\u2019s more about the eating routine than the food itself (so long as it\u2019s more than meat, dairy, and carbs).\n\nThere\u2019s also no shame caving and having some delicacies from back home. One of my favorite moments was with a friend in Germany after 10 days when she was desperate for a \u2018normal\u2019 meal and then picked a Chinese restaurant. No need to force yourself to constantly eat the national food if there are other options you prefer more and the food isn\u2019t adding to your experience",
      "I don\u2019t know how I adjust, I just naturally do. I absolutely love the food aspect! Spain is one of my favourite countries for food!! I could eat only bocadillo ibericos and tapas for daysss\n\nIn all seriousness, I\u2019d recommend buying something from the supermarket to keep at my accomodation (like pre-packed vege or fruit salads, bananas, yoghurt + granola, smoothies etc) or go to a market and buy some fresh meat, cheese, bread etc to make my own sandwiches whenever I don\u2019t feel like finding a place to eat. Then I always have a backup plan if I struggle to find a place to eat and it makes me less stressed knowing I don\u2019t need to go hungry.",
      "Study the food culture and learn local, especially regional specific dishes, e.g. fiduea in Barcelona vs. paella in Valencia.\n\nLook up restaurants in the area, both through food websites online and Google Maps. Narrow in on places serving specific cuisines or dishes of interest.\n\nLook at places offering your preferred cuisine and compare hours, locations, reviews, and food photos. Narrow down a list based on what places look like the best fit.\n\nIf you're in a high tourist traffic area, like a lot of Spain (what part are you in?), chances are you're going to need reservations at a lot of desirable sit down restaurants. Plan accordingly.\n\nKeep a shortlist of more flexible restaurants in terms of hours/table availability, and plan on going to one of them if you can't get into one of the restaurants higher on your list.\n\nIf you find a new dish or place you particularly like, lean into it and either revisit to explore more of the menu or find other places serving similar dishes. Same story if you find you don't like something after all. Build off your experiences.",
      "Hi OP. Ive been to India nearly a dozen times and the first few times I did dread it because I'm not really into Indian cuisine... Okay so there's a couple of dishes I love, also the vast majority of Indians are vegetarian, and I'm a big meat eater. Whenever I visit cities where meat isn't allowed, I usually get by on snacks - fries, soups & the like. The food aspect no longer worries me but I think if I went to other countries in asia like Japan, Vietnam, I might really struggle :)\nI never plan when to eat although I do research restaurants on Trip Advisor",
      "I can\u2019t eat gluten, so it is genuinely the hardest part for me. When I was in Switzerland and starving a few weeks ago, I\u2019d have to go to at least 4 restaurants before I found one that was gluten free. At one point I had a mini breakdown because I wished I could eat regular food. Also, this was with a ton of research about restaurants in the area. Sometimes the hours for places are wonky.",
      "I eat several small meals a day. I will normally visit a grocery store and have food I can carry with me for when I don't find a meal that looks like something I want.",
      "Always ask a local (or several locals) where they eat, you'll find the best  food. People do enjoy really long meals. It is common for people to spend 2-3 hours socialising whilst they eat.\n\nTapas are great, and so are sandwiches, but that isn't really the Mediterranean diet, which Spain is truly known for. Of course, it all boils down to your budget. However, you can eat menus (3 course meals for \u20ac15-\u20ac20).\n\nFood, beer, and wine is something you should invest in when in Spain. It's worth the experience, especially if you are a foodie (by that, I mean someone who isn't a picky eater and likes trying new things).",
      "I can\u2019t eat gluten or soy. So that\u2019s even more fun. So before I went to Rome I made a list of gf friendly restaurants and found quite a few. Once I arrived I found even more. Huge relief! Italian food is almost impossible for me to eat normallyx",
      "Usually certain places have specialties.  So eat the local specialty - live a little.  \n\nI echo the Spain is actually pretty easy, food wise.  But if you don\u2019t eat fish, then yeah, I can see you getting sick of jamon.  Find some tapas and pastries and sopas and paella.  If you\u2019re up near Madrid, you can probably find some non Spanish food.  If you\u2019re on the southern coast, there\u2019s British food almost everywhere.  And if you\u2019re near the southwest, you can find delicious Moroccan food.  Under no circumstances should you be eating PB&Js.",
      "Stock on food at the bakeries, delis and supermarkets.",
      "Dont be hard on yourself to eat local - def try the cuisine, but not everyone is adventurous with food, and that's okay! Food can make a huge difference to mood and energy levels - everyone is different. You can use google maps to find food that you're craving, comfort meals etc A cheeky fast food run here and there is fine too - you'll build up to it!",
      "When travelling I wake up extra early to get more meals in. I like going to markets to look at local produce. Usually a lot of food there! I also like to experience how the locals eat. Or if at a hotel, ask them to book for me.",
      "Trying out new and exotic foods is like 73.839363% of why I love to travel. Expand those horizons. Worst thing that\u2019ll happen is a meal you don\u2019t like.",
      "Same here. I always get stressed out about where to eat when Im doing my solo travelers. Basically what I do is check out the must try food/local cuisine then I would look for places offering that in google maps. I think checking a week before is alright but earlier is better. I would always set the filters according to my estimated budget and only choose those with above 4 ratings. \n\nSometimes I just go where there is a long line haha worked for me in Ghent as I had the best fries of my life. Worst case scenario for me would be getting fastfood haha",
      "I would suggest google searching the meal times for the country you are visiting, and going by those times. If you\u2019re used to eating dinner early, I would suggest going to the grocery store, and getting some snacks to tide you over until dinner time. I always enjoy checking out the grocery stores anyway, because it gives a look into what locals are actually eating. You might just find some interesting things that aren\u2019t available in your home country! It\u2019s an adventure! \n\nI typically will google search what the food of the city or region I\u2019m in is, so I can try out restaurants that specialize in that. I\u2019m a fairly adventurous eater, so I\u2019m typically game for whatever the local specialty is.\n\nFor finding restaurants, I typically use the google maps app. I pay close attention to the ratings, and I will browse several recent reviews.\n\nIf language is the issue, I would recommend the google translate app.\n\nI just realized that I sound like an ad for Google, haha. \ud83e\udd23 But it\u2019s what I use!!",
      "I love food but it does get exhausting planning all that when you're also tired from sightseeing. My tactic has been to do a mix. I plan out restaurants that I want to go to but I also supplement that plan with breakfast at the hotel. Another good thing might be to get familiar with local fast food chains. That has been helpful to me in Japan. There are a lot of really ubiquitous chain restaurants that are good for a quick meal when you're hungry but tired and not up for a full on dining experience.",
      "I wouldn\u2019t say I dread food during travel (especially not in Italy lol) but I do find it\u2019s kind of annoying and stressful sometimes to solo dine. I definitely feel my options are more limited unless I want to eat my meal feeling super self-conscious, so I often end up at pretty casual places or big markets/cafeteria places where the food is cheap and solo diners don\u2019t stand out. I\u2019m actually going to Spain next week and specifically opted into breakfast at my hotel so there\u2019s one less meal I need to think about every day lol.\n\nAlso can be frustrating if you have allergies and don\u2019t know a local food is commonly cooked with an allergen you wouldn\u2019t think of. For example, I had no idea a lot of the gelato shops (at least in Florence) used hazelnuts until I was walking back to my hotel and felt my tongue start swelling lol.",

      "Food tours. You area able to try a lot of different foods without committing to one restaurant. There are some decent ones in Airbnb experiences, but read the reviews. I had one really good experience on a food tour in Istanbul.",
      "I'm kind of in the same boat haha. I don't really tend to enjoy food in general so when I travel it's awful and tend to loose weight pretty rapidly. Half the time I rely on supermarkets which I'm sure is not great for health but...\n\nAlthough if you're happy with it I don't think there's any shame in eating repeatedly at the same places/same dishes as long as they're relatively healthy.",

      "spain was pretty good for food last time i was there? maybe there's an issue with siesta, thats entirely possible. but its not like tapas are the only food in spain. google maps is your friend. you have i think local things like your tapas, your pinchos, paella, horxata et cetera. there are some mexican-ish places, though they're different from what is served elsewhere. morrocan food is possible and i was somewhat surprised to find a dutch snackbar. you have plenty of what id consider standard european restaurants too, where you can get protein with fries and salad et cetera. a decent amount of high end restaurants, some very famous. if you miss home, you dont see southern us food in europe though. so that might be bad news. although something more northern us like a burger or us pizza is widely available.",
      "I usually do one of a few things depending on my mood.\n\n1) a food tour - this is a nice way to eat a diverse amount of food in a small amount of time and can be relatively cheap depending where you sign up. You can also meet people and the guides usually give a recommendation for what to eat.\n2) walking around and just exploring some random hole in the wall while seeing the sites (this could be expensive if you\u2019re in the touristy areas though)\n3) planning and saving specific restaurants you really want to try\n4) i always have groceries on hand but i buy half of what i expect to eat for my stay to give myself room to try things outside. Usually stock up on protein or veggies since the food outside tends to be less heavy on those.\n5) when i\u2019m feeling homesick (been traveling for awhile now) i give myself grace and just get a cheeseburger at mcdonald\u2019s or some other comforting, familiar food. Being in a foreign country is overwhelming! Sometimes you need a little familiarity to get through it.\n\nHaving a variety of options and planning a bit ahead of time makes eating less of a chore and more fun. Hope this helps!",
      "With my bf we only go to restaurant (sometimes cheap) at night. During the day we eat at supermarket. Mercadona is a great one, they are a caterer area with pizza, fresh food and sushi.\n\nI choose all the restaurant I want to eat before going. Sometimes it is a list of 20 places. And I save them on google maps. It is easier to take decision and have visibility about what is around you \ud83e\udd2d",

I was so full all the time I could never have eaten 3 meals a day.\n\nBy the end we were looking for either modern Spanish places, or Asian food (Vietnamese, Japanese, Indian). More vegetables and less heavy.\n\nTo the planning question: I did make extensive food maps but found that a lot of the restaurants that were recommended were very touristy or always packed. Instead, when hungry, I'd open Google maps, filter for what's open and close, spend a few minutes reading reviews and then go.",
      "I'm vegan so it's really awesome to look up 'vegan food near me' and seeing what's around. In other countries they just have a lot of dishes that happen to be vegan so that's also cool :D since you probably are not, I would recommend choosing a favorite dish and looking up \n\n'x' near me \n\nand going through reviews and seeing which you fancy and trying it out :3\n\nWhen I travel with friends we each pick a few places and do little reviews for ourselves on our digital camera lmao, we love eating. \n\nHaving a budget and choosing some fancier places and some local places to mix it up really makes it interesting, when I allowed myself to splurge I was able to try such unique dishes. I've had such good food in some places that I've traveled back just to get it again! \n\nAlso trying bakeries and dessert places are really fun! There's so many things to try :)",
      "I research and book restaurants far in advance. I also take advantage of my Airbnbs and eat some meals in my apartment, nothing fancy but I do take advantage of the plethora of delicious local meats, cheeses and fruits. The local food market is great too as they offer cheap eats as well.",

      "I love food when I travel, and to address specifically the issue of finding good places to eat, I have found that asking them hostel/hotel reception or concierge (idk your travel style) can generate a list of good places to eat, and sometimes even places to avoid. Similarly you can also usually ask tour guides for recommendations. \n\nAnother strategy I use is to map a route to my next attraction and look for interesting/well reviewed looking restaurants along the way on google maps. A lot of places have their menus and websites accessible online linked from map services. I did this this morning in Budapest and got some great cheesy crepes out of it :)",

      "How can you say such a thing??\nI travel JUST for the food and eat all day long!\n\nTrying to find food is simple, check out delivery services, look for recommendations on reddit, ask locals or staff or just get lost and get food wherever you end up. \n\nI get lost so often and keep finding the coolest places because of it.\nOther than that many small snacks and meals during the day fill you up too :)",
      "I love the food angle when traveling. Love digging into new cuisines, new food traditions and customs, love going to grocery stores and seeing what exotic (to me) items are offered. All of it. \n\nBut. I have celiac, and that has complicated my travel eating for the last decade. And when traveling with my family, we have 2 celiacs, a type 1 diabetic, and a severe food allergy sufferer to feed. So while I love traveling via food, it does not love me back. \n\nI always have a backpack full of food in case we can\u2019t find anything when we need it, and my first agenda item in any new place is to hit the nearest grocery store to stock up on things. Mainly breakfast foods and snacky things that can be carried around. I used to go to foreign groceries for fun, like an anthropological expedition. Now, it\u2019s necessity. Still fun, but less so sometimes. \n\nI spend a lot of time looking for restaurants on Google maps, reading reviews, checking opening hours\u2026sometimes getting to just the right place has taken us way off the beaten path and becomes an adventure in itself!

      "I get tired of it too, having to \"go out to eat\" all the time. Or spending money on a large meal when I'm not very hungry. So, my partner and I have Ramen noodle nights once or twice a week when we're on the road. We get the ones in a cup with a fork, and there's sooo many types to choose from (Asia obviously is best for this). We don't get super sick of then, even after 1x or 2x a week for months. We shower, watch a movie and eat Ramen. Netflix and chill on the road lol. We save a ton of money, too. Other options like this are pre-cooked grocery store items (like the ready to eat stuff from the deli), or shitty gas station/convenience store food once in a while. These stores will heat up whatever food you buy there for you. Most hotels have an employee microwave they will also let you use or heat stuff up for you! And there's always delivery apps too.",
      "For me when I travel I always look for the places where the locals eat, where is crowded , get the best food , always fresh , good prices , get to talk with locals and find more info about the city , nightlife , other good places to eat . Best thing you can do if you're an explorer!",

      "Hey!! I just got back from a two week trip to spain and while some of the food was amazing i also tired of maintenance meals. Started getting instant ramen and eggs so i could leave with breakfast already in my system and did a mix of sandwiches and snacks for breakfast. Tried to research harder for dinners to mix it up. Had a great tapas meal at el nacional, really not comparable to the smaller pubs and bars versions.",
      "I'm the same as you, I research places to eat at before I leave home, when I'm still planning my itinerary. Food isn't important to me when I travel, so I find places that are cheap, fast and close to attractions I am visiting. I have a panic moment if I am hungry, tired and can't figure out where to eat that won't be too expensive or too much of a language barrier, so I try to avoid at all costs by advance planning.",
      "You are putting way too much thought into this. For most meals I just stop where ever is close by. You can use Google maps and press the restaurant button. Now if I want something really good I ask the locals. People working at hotels, gas stations and so on are excellent resources. You can also do some food research on Google to find some highly rated places to eat as well.\n\nFood is something I never have an issue finding.",
      "This might not work for people who are used to eating proper meals but even though I\u2019m a foodie, when I solo travel, most of the time I only eat one full proper sit down meal a day (mostly lunch), max two. I eat small bites through out the day, like a sandwich here, some tea and cookies there. Japan was really good for this since their convenience stores are amazing. Paris and Italy as well since their pastries, breads and ice creams are great. You could go to a grocery store and get some fruit, cold cuts and bread and stuff for breakfast and dinner. \n\nThen again, on average I eat less than others do and I\u2019ll eat pretty much anything as long as it\u2019s interesting and sort of new.",

I eat a mixture of local stuff and international stuff and I don't care about what you are \"supposed\" to do. I look for restaurants before I travel and bookmark them so I don't have to spend time looking when I am there. If I want to eat fast food, I will. If I want to eat Korean food in Paris, I will (I did). I do try to adjust to the eating schedule, but sometimes you can find non-traditional restaurants that are open during siesta. If you aren't interested in Spanish food, or the timing really doesn't work for you, there is no reason to force yourself.",
      "Having to eat 2-3 meals a day is not exhausting for me! haha. If I'm too tired to eat out, I just order food delivery or buy a take out meal. I still follow my own eating time. I try as many food as I can. But I don't try them all at once. If I'm not that hungry, I just grab some snacks. I don't pressure myself to eat a full meal if I don't feel like it.",
      "I enjoy traveling to cities, so it's street food all the way! Easy to find, easy on the wallet and almost always wonderfully delicious- if not.... oh look at what this one has!",
      "I went to Spain for three weeks and ***said*** I would grocery shop and just ended up living off beer and tapas for the whole time. I went to maybe 10 max actual sit down restaurants and I honestly regret not going to more and not grocery shopping as much as I thought. \n\nWhen I did grocery shop I made sandwiches with jam\u00f3n and cheese and some caprese type deals with oil and vin but other than a handful or two of restaurant and homemade meals it was bar food the whole time. \n\nIdk keep it cheap and seasonal and fresh and tasty",
      "I lower my standards. It's my spiciest traveling hot take, but I really don't judge if you want fast food or whatever is cheap or convenient while on the go. That way when I actually have a restaurant or street food experience, I'm savoring and enjoying, and I'm not hangry because I was hiking and now it's a 45 minute wait before I can sit and order. Convenience when traveling, in order to better prioritize my time and money.",
      "It does get tiring going out for every meal after a while. Some days I just get snacks from the local grocery store and call it good. Or eating meals that just sound good to you instead of pressuring yourself to eat local foods. Sometimes a cheeseburger is best.",
      "Hahah I love this question. Love Spain and I hope you get everything your foodie heart desires ;(.\n\n\nSo when traveling to any country for a period of time more than 2 days lol , my very first stop is the coolest supermarket and it market I can find. If I have an Airbnb or even a small kitchen I gather snacks I KNOW and love and some traditional country foods and move on from there. I\u2019m the USA restaurants are open all the time so I find it always makes me readjust my \u201cfood\u201d thinking and timing to accommodate where I am ;) \n\nIf it\u2019s within your budget- stop at random cafes, go to local eateries and dine out when you can to try other things. I\u2019m a solo traveler so this is easily ideal for one.",

      "I like to research and plan restaurants to visit, but also like the street food. Stopping at a random stand and getting something that\u2019s not back home is part of the travel experience for me."

    "selftext": "I'm in Rome and today I had a guy come up to me while I was sitting on a bench. He explained that he was from Hungary where he worked as a painter, had three more days of vacation in Rome, but had run out of money. He then straight up asked me to buy him some pasta at a place nearby. I told him I was on a low budget myself but offered him to bananas I had, which he ended up taking.\n\nI've had something similar happen on my previous trip, pre covid, at a bus terminal in i think Vienna. Guy comes up, explains that he was visiting from the Balkans with some vague story about how his cash ran out and asks me to buy him some fast food at the kiosk. This guy actually got pissy when I offered him something I had on me, calling it shit food. This guy must've been in his 40s, the guy today about 30.\n\nMaybe I'm too skeptical, but I don't really buy their story of just running out of money for food. At the same time I can't really figure out what their deal is it they are lying. Are they just really cheap travelers trying to eat for free? Something else?\n\nAnyone who has experienced this? I'd like to know if this is a common phenomenon or just a coincidence that it happened twice to me.",

      "I'm guessing they're just local panhandlers, and the \"I'm a tourist who had some hard luck\" story is working for them to get tourists to give them money. It's an icebreaker that lets them approach random strangers since a lot of backpackers are interested in meeting other backpackers, plus it makes them seem relatable, then they can ask for money/food and lean on the social awkwardness.",
      "this is a common scam. you go pay for the food and then he splits what you paid with the restaurant.",
      "Comon scam, similar to the the ones next to a bus or train station where they claim they just need a couple of coins more to buy the tiket. Always with a sad story of how they are out of money and desoarate, blbla\n\nI actually was out of money in vienna and solved it without aproaching anyone. And if i did i would have accepted anything, junk food or not, i was really hungry and my bank transfer was delayed a couple of days",
      "Weird, in all my travels I've never experienced something like that. Got some locals begging for money or food, in such case depending on the situation I might actually help, but from other tourists never. The second one definitely sounds sketchy.",
      "Unfortunately, this is very common. These folks are panhandling hustlers. Just say no and tell them to leave you alone. Often if you given them money, they\u2019ll use it for booze or drugs \u2014 and that\u2019s especially true if you offer them food and they refuse it.\n\nThere are support networks like soup kitchens and other charitable organizations for street people who are genuinely hungry, so don\u2019t feel bad about refusing them.\n\nInvariably, the best piece of advice is to avoid anyone on the street who approaches you unbidden. They\u2019re almost always crooks and scam artists.",

It would take them longer to beg for enough money to buy it themselves and most people think they did something good, because they helped someone.\n\nVery popular is also the \"I just need \u20ac5 to buy my ticket\" and even if you offer to buy the ticket, the just go to the information desk and exchange it for cash.",
      "People ask for food because they have more success than with asking for money. It doesnt have to be a scam, maybe just taking advantage of other's kindness or guilt.\n\nIf you dont want to give then just stay no and stick to it. Keep in mimd that beggars can be scammy however they are also often really poor and in need.",

      "I was there a few years ago. The people begging for food were Syrian refugees when I was there. I was happy to share.",
      "Not similar to yours, but another take on begging - using children to bring in the money.\n\nIndia (Delhi). My first encounter with beggars didn't go well and I felt like shit afterwards...\n\nI came out of a KFC, and just after I got beyond the 'guarded' doors, a woman with her young children approached me all with their hands out, some doing a hand to mouth gesture.\n\nI dug into my pockets and gave the lady lots of tiny change, the equivelent of 1p & 2ps which had been collecting in my pocket. She rushed off quickly leaving me surrounded by all these children whom I had nothing to give.\n\nOn my latter visits to this city (I'm usually in & out asap, it's a tourist trap) I've seen beggars aggressively pointing & pushing (their?) tiny children at tourists to ask/show they need food or money.\n\nNowadays, I don't give to people full stop, Guess I've become so desensitized to this kind of thing.",
      "I was at the train station in Vienna and two young men approached telling me they were refugees and asking for food. I was in a hurry but walked them into a nearby McDonalds and bought them meals, and left them to it. They were very polite and appreciative and looked genuinely hungry. It can\u2019t be an easy thing begging for food\u2026I imagine the genuine ones get a lot of rejection because there are many more bad actors out there who say they\u2019re hungry but ultimately just want money for drugs. Sometimes you just have to go with your gut feeling on it."

Hehe\n\nThings I miss (off the top of my head):\n\n\\- Lok-lok by the roadside\n\n\\- Goreng pisang (this is grammatically incorrect haha that's just what I call it - fried bananas with awesome chilli sauce, often coupled with fresh coconut), fried cempedak (a kind of fruit), keropok lekor (essentially fried fish sticks made from fish paste, could be super chewy OR crispy)\n\n\\- Bakkwa (similar to jerky, but it's savory-sweet. In my opinion has a much better texture than jerky). Growing up, I had this with white bread (as a sandwich). It's typically made of pork, so not halal.\n\n\\- Otah (I eat this with bread too)\n\n\\- Malay/ Nyonya kuihs that get sold by the boxes in the back of a lorry by the roadside (eg. this one with steamed glutinous rice filled with spicy shrimp & sambal called Pulut Panggang, Kuih Lapis (colorful layered soft rice flour pudding, according to Google haha i don't know how else to describe it), Seri Muka (2 layers, top one is a green custard layer, bottom one is steamed glutinous rice), and how can I forget: curry puffs (with either sardine or the classic ones with potato and egg - there's also 2 kinds of pastry shells, one flakes and one does not - TRY BOTH!). Heck even Malay-style doughnuts are done with sweet potato and the texture/sugar coating is different. I love them too.\n\n\\- Grilled & charred chicken wings (hawker center food), with lime squeezed over it and with a good chilli\n\n\\- Good solid durians :p\n\n\\- Jambu (my favourite fruit)\n\n\\- Starfruit! Not that I'm especially in love, but it's really rare elsewhere.\n\n\\- Satay (charred at the right places with meat so tender it slides off the skewers, a flavorful peanut sauce and all the small ketupats, onions and cucumbers on the side)\n\n\\- Goes without saying: Nasi Lemak --> so many kinds that you can eat depending on your budget: there's fancy kinds with fried fish/ fried chicken as a side, but at the minimum you get some kind of boiled/fried egg, a good sambal, fragrant rice, some ikan bilis (fried anchovies), peanuts and cucumber slices.\n\n\\- Banana Leaf Rice (oh! the variety!)\n\n\\- Nasi Briyani\n\n\\- Roti Prata (& other mamak stall f&b like mee goreng, teh tarik, savory murtabak)\n\n\\- Ramly burgers (saucy, egg-wrapped burgers) SO SINFUL BUT SO GOOD\n\n\\- SALTED EGG YOLK CRABS (with fried buns to dip in the sauce T.T)\n\n\\- Hokkien mee (not the singaporean kind, the black sauce kind that is cooked with deep fried pork lard)\n\n\\- Penang Assam Laksa (the kind with a clear-ish sour broth with tons of noodles and sardine? and spices, not the kind with coconut milk)\n\n\\- Bak Kut Teh (pork ribs cooked in a herbal broth, goes amazingly well with rice and pickled vegetables)\n\nand of course, due to the proximity of the countries - jap/korean bbq/thai/indonesian food that are all amazing and accessible. Our desserts - all the shaved ice (ice kacang of various sorts), etc. And all the beverages we drink. (eg. putting grass jelly in soy milk).\n\nWe also have a lot of non-authentic fusion-style Western food that still suits our palettes (crab roe pasta! the controversial nasi-lemak burgers!).\n\nI think maybe I'm just a little bit homesick. There's a lot that are not listed since this list is personal to me, but I hope if you ever visit Malaysia, check all of these out. Haven't been back in 2 years :(\n\nThis was an oddly difficult comment to write for me. sad",
      "I've often found that the various countries/peoples diaspora has resulted in some amazing food.  \n\nA lot of folks get precious about authentic food made by authentic locals using authentic ancient methods and authentic ingredients  harvested by authentic farmers.   \n\nI remember reading a travel column by Greek who wrote that if he was in Nagasaki or Shanghai and saw a Greek restaurant, hell yes, he'd go in. If it was run by some Greek expats, it would be neat to see how local ingredients and tastes influenced  what they presented and if it was run by some folks who were not Greek, he'd be even more curious.

      "Georgia (the country)\n\nI really believe Georgian cuisine is a hidden gem and ready for a time to shine.  There are so many different types of cheese and foods that I had never heard of that blew me away.  Look up khachapuri, khinkali, ojakhuri, churchkhela and try not to have your mouth water.  And if that doesn't sell you, Georgia has arguably the oldest wine-making traditions in the world, with many wines unavailable outside of Georgia or the former Soviet Union that are dirt cheap and taste fantastic.",
      "Chinese food, or, more specifically, the food in China.\n\nI lived out there for a year and the variety of both Chinese food and food from other places was top tier. I still ate a lot of western stuff, which was as good as it is back home, but having the option to get amazing noodles and being able to grab a jianbing for breakfast or something... I miss it. I had some incredible Japanese and Korean dishes too. All super cheap. Even the plain rice out there is better lmao. \n\nAlso, I am a total boba fiend so it's a pain to be back in the UK and have to pay \u00a34 for a shitty drink rather than 9 kuai for my fav milk tea.",
      "Macedonian and Bulgarian food was my favorite; really nice array of cheeses and other very fresh and light foods in salad form, especially good heirloom tomatoes and yellow peppers mixed into very liquidy salads. Flavorful garlicky beans with olive oil and lemon juice, delicious yogurt and cold soups. It is the best mix of fresh, light flavors and foods and heavier, fatty dairy and grilled meats I've found, like Greek food but better.\n\nAlso, monastic food in Greece is really good. 90% ambiguous bean stew that you chop some raw onions into but it turns out really good somehow.",

It\u2019s days like this that make me question why the fuck I am doing what I\u2019m doing. Vomited five times in succession last night and it was so gnarly. Everything was red (Tandoori Chicken, not blood)\u2026. Now I have a fever and am just laying in this hostel room listening to Spanish videos all day. My body aches.\n\nBetween the anxiety and chaos of Delhi, the terrifying winding roads of Ladakh, and getting sick as a dog, I almost wonder why I\u2019m doing this to myself. Perhaps I\u2019m masochistic but I think I would still do it over again, fever and all.\n\nSend some good energy to me, friends, hopefully I can make it for my planned 3.5 months in India.

      "am an Indian who eats on the street frequently and ended up with a bout of food poisoning in pahalgam. kashmir this year turned out to be amoebiasis . .some tips I have followed since then... drink bottled water only..eat fruits in case a decent place is not around to eat..keep packaged  snacks....biscuits etc eat only places where the locals approve of ...also disposable plates and cups are better ..as washing of vessels in soiled water is a big problem...hot cooked food..like dal khichdi ,dal roti should be okay",
      "When I\u2019m on the Indian subcontinent I go vegetarian. If you need motivation, go to the meat section of a food market there. Then wonder why you don\u2019t get sick *every* time you eat meat. Granted, I\u2019ve never escaped without a bit of an upset stomach, but never full on food poisoning.",
      "You're probably zooting to the first street-side joint you see. Even the average middle-class Indian avoids those and it's rather foolhardy to think it's all the same. \n\nGo to restaurants with AC and indoor dining. They will serve you hygienic food that's always hot and abiding by food quality standards and tradition.\n\nRegarding spices, avoid places where you see oily red gravy or gravy with specks of red. That means they've reused old oil, not cooked the chillies properly and/or added artificial food coloring. \n\nGood restaurants don't use those, and there are plenty of excellent places in Delhi. Use Google Reviews or ratings on local food delivery apps like Zomato and Swiggy, which pretty much every major restaurant is a member of post-covid.\n\nAlso, if you can't handle spice, stick to things like butter chicken, shahi paneer and other Mughlai, Kashmiri or Punjabi dishes.\n\nAnd most importantly - buy bottled water. The aforementioned indoor restaurants usually have filtered water, but avoid being served water anywhere else.",
      "I'm indian but whenever i go to india i avoid meat at all cost. Make sure the food you are eating is piping hot and you're drinking bottled water.",
      "Oh I've been there buddy. Had awful food poisoning in Mexico/Guatemala where I was dying from both ends. I also questioned why I was doing this to myself. And then after some rest and self care my body recuperated. It's astonishing what our bodies do for us to keep us safe. You'll get through it!",
      "Always buy bottled water and never drink tap. Enjoy your time. I got Delhi belly so often and bad food poisoning once from mutton. Ate mostly veg after or cooked myself. In times of struggle I wanted to leave but never did. Now I\u2019m not there and missing India a lot. I\u2019m going back",
      "I believe you get some of the best food in the world in Delhi, but if you're not careful you could also die haha. And I say this as someone who's spent 6 years there",
      "Sorry you're sick!! Pepto bismol can be incredible for food poisoning. But I'm not sure if that works for vomiting. It's for the other end lol. I'm worried about having the same experience in India despite living in Vietnam and Mexico for years. \n\nSoooo many of my friends have gotten very sick over the years and it's always the damn chicken!!\n\nI'm sure you know this already but just in case: my general rule is that I won't eat anywhere that doesn't have a group of locals already eating there.",
      "I see some people here saying vegetarian is a safer bet..not exactly so from my experience cos I ate egg biryani in one of those stalls along the mountain trail from Manali to Ladakh, and i got very very sick and no worse place to get food poisoning than one a bus skidding through the mountains and you can\u2019t afford to throw up on such a long bus ride cos everyone is going to be pissed at you. I projectile vomited everything. Best bet if you are on your way to Ladakh is maggi or processed food all the way",
      "The probiotic Saccharomyces Boulardii can help **[prevent food poisoning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3296087/)**.\n\nThe brand name *Florastor* is relatively expensive and makes some extra claims, but the generic is cheap and should be widely available.\n\nGood luck - I hope you feel better!",
      "It\u2019s more likely to be the water than the food tbh. Don\u2019t get ice in drinks, drink only bottled water, keep mouth closed when showering and used bottled water to brush teeth. When buying food, only purchase food which is being cooked fresh for you right there and then. Vegetarian fare is preferable. If buying cold food, buy only pre-packaged food or food with a natural barrier like whole fruits. Have hand sanitiser on hand and use it frequently.",
      "I kept getting sick in India a well and I realized why after visiting a market that sold meat.\nSo many flies in one place.\n\nAfter that I mainly ate veg and that was a game changer.\nI only reserved meat eating forsuper fancy an popular places. \nThank goodness there is a lot of awesome veg food in India.\nMarsala dosas, Gobi Manchurian, southern thalis.\n\nI wish you a speedy recovery and on the positive side, you are probably going to be more resilient after this journey.",
      "Most common food poisoning is from protozoa. Not from bacteria- your body would be exposed to bacteria in the West also. \n\nAsk a doctor about taking a medicine like Nitazoxanide which will also help with viral gastrointestinal infections.\n\nGet a typhoid and Hep A vaccine before traveling to India.",
      "I had my fair share of food poisoning in Thailand too. I'm a white boy and my stomach just does not handle Asia well... I think it all really depends on your sensitivity to local spices, local microbiome of the consumed food and god knows what else.\n\nFrom my experience, the moment I try street food, no matter how popular and well-hygienic the place is, it's still a gamble and I can end up hugging toilet regardless. Getting carried to my hotel room by taxi whilst puking my guts out is one of the perks of travelling Asia I guess \ud83e\udd23.\n\nI tried playing around with probiotics (taking them couple of weeks ahead of my trip and whilst on the trip) and that had exactly zero impact. Got poisoned anyway so you can probably save your money. There definitely needs to be more research done on this.\n\nHaving said that, I just came back from New Delhi unscathed (apart from having diarrhea on pretty much daily basis).\n\nOthers here are advising going vegetarian but that oftentimes won't work as veggies can get bacteria on them too since street vendors can wash them in sewage water...\n\nSo my personal algorithm at this point is:\n\n1. Avoid street food at all costs and only go to foreigner friendly restaurants\n2. If I feel bold, eat only deep fried street food that's been fried in front of me\n\nIn the end, it's all about how much of a risk taker you are.\n\nStay hydrated, and get well soon!",
      "there is NO food hygiene in south asia, that\u2019s coming from someone who\u2019s parents are from there\u2026\n\nnever eat street food, only go to western based restaurants (IE mcdonald\u2019s) and you should be okay. no ice either, only bottled drinks",
      "As an Indian I want to give some suggestions...\n\n1.Don't drink tap water or even water they serve in restaurant (like in pots or other utensils).... Always go for packaged water...\n\n2. Don't eat from every random shops especially non-vegetarian food... Even we Indians suffer from food poisoning from these... Always go for some reputed or the one which looks clean... \n\n3. Avoid street shops, I know it looks tempting but they rarely care about food hygiene... If you are a foriegner that's a big no no... You can avail these street foods even in proper restaurant... \n\nFinal suggestion: India is not only northern 'over crowded' India but also includes south and eastern India... Which are less crowded and you can explore different from usual \"INDIAN\" stuffs...",

      "I feel for ya! It happened to me a couple of times on different trips to India.  I lost a lot of weight with no appetite for weeks after being sick onetime.  I wish you a speedy recovery.  Do you plan to leave Delhi? For me, getting out to the smaller villages and leaving the big city was what made the trip really worthwhile (and I did wonder, at times each time I visited, why am I doing this?!).  But at the end it is so worth it.  For me, I do not enjoy spending time in Delhi, but I dont mean the city any disrespect, I am just not a city person.  I hope you can feel better and enjoy yourself soon!\nPs- I\u2019ll end with one little story.  Onetime I got food poisoning in India and was bedridden for days.  I was travelling alone (as I usually do) and had to get another traveller to let my family know what was up because I was too weak to even send an email.  Finally, after a few days I felt ready to try some food.  I am a vegetarian, and just wanted something simple\u2026 I asked for plain rice.  The rice arrives and I put the first scoop in my mouth.  Something crunchy? I spit it out and see \u2026.\u2026\u2026 a massive cockroach that I just chewed!!    Appetite was lost again hahahaha\n\nGood luck over there!!",

(Then again 3 weeks ago in Albania, I must be doing something wrong)\n\nMake sure you go easy on your gut for a little while. Eat easily digestible food's for a week or two and avoid alcohol. I didn't and as a result I had stomach pains and kept throwing up for weeks after I got home.. can really mess up your trip.\n\nAlso, I'm sorry about the chicken tandoori. I'm guessing you won't be having any for a while. Feel better soon!",
      "I'm also one month into a trip in India.\n\nThere was one time I woke up in the middle of the night feeling sick, threw up once, and then felt totally alright. Almost like when you drink too much, but I didnt have any drink. I'm guessing I was not careful with water.\n\nOther than that thing, I still didn't get food poisoning. I usually take some time walking around to find a place to eat, and I only pick places that are full of people, even if I have to wait. I'm also being vegetarian 90% of the time, I guess that helps.\n\nBut I gotta say, I'm really starting to miss fish and I doubt I will be able to hold it back for one more month.",
      "Do you think you know how you acquired food poisoning the 1st time?",
      "Be careful of \u201cwhipped cream\u201d which can be made from powdered mix.\n\nI spent a month in India in both cities and rural areas. I was SO careful but I did eat meat sometimes and gave in to street food (and train snacks) on several occasions. Didn\u2019t get sick!\n\nMy very last night in Kolkata, I was staying in a fancy hotel. I ordered ice cream from room service. It arrived and was delicious and even had a dollop of whipped cream! Whipped cream was a weird texture but I didn\u2019t think much of it. A few hours later\u2026 I was so sick. I realized the whipped \u201ccream\u201d must have been like Dream Whip powder, made with (at least partially) tap water.",
      "Delhi belly IRL \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI went to India last year and managed to avoid getting sick. I\u2019m vegetarian (may or may not help), drank only bottled water (though I brushed with the tap), and only ate at really established places (I.e., no roadside). I had a quick trip and really wanted to avoid getting sick, but I\u2019m heading back soon and am preparing for it so I can try more food!!"

      "Fuck yeah man. I love trying new stuff but I also love fast food and shit take aways. Especially when you\u2019re solo travelling, you get to go exactly what you want to do!\n\nDid you know that Italy does mini calzone things at McDonald\u2019s? Or that rice comes with you KFC in Vietnam? Still interesting to compare. Do what ever you like broski, no judgement here.",
      "will get roasted for this on reddit but honestly on the list of reasons i enjoy travelling the food is near the bottom. i\u2019ll try whatever there is but it\u2019s never been a reason for me to get excited about visiting a place and i\u2019m never ashamed of just grabbing a pizza or a burger or whatever",
      "Everyone does their thing. I prefer to look for local fast food if there is any, like souvlaki or german sausages etc.",
      "Same. I eat what I feel like when traveling. I've had annoying gatekeeping backpackers before (\"duuude you have to eat the local food ALWAYS\") and they can f off.",
      "Yep, all the time. I eat plenty of good local food too, but I don\u2019t stress about getting fast food if it\u2019s what I want in the moment. Don\u2019t let any kind of notion of a proper way to travel get in the way of what you really want. It\u2019s your trip, do what you want!",
      "not American fast food but I generally ate nothing but doner kebab traveling in Europe",
      "A room picnic with comfort food and Netflix is an essential part of travel for me. Enjoy without guilt!",
      "Nah never at chains I have at home, but at local fast food jaunts (usually not chains) all the time",
      "I did UK-style  Indian takeaway a few times in Portugal originally because I was trying to find some Goa-style Portuguese-Indian food and didn't really know where to find it.",
      "I do. It saves money so I don't spend my whole budget on food. I especially do in airports because almost everything else is a complete rip off.",
      "Fast food restaurants exist because they are quick and in convenient spots, and sometimes you need that when traveling. I've had plenty of Burger King and McDonalds meals in train stations when I probably could've walked down the street for something local, but that walk outside can feel like a marathon in the middle of a trip.",
      "Generally I'm travelling for places not food and try to eat as cheaply as possible (arguably that in itself is more authentic than eating at a touristic restaurant anyway!) I'm not a massive fast food fan but most european supermarkets do great salads, the rucla one in spain is amazing imho and i wish i could get it again back home",
      "fast food and takeout, definitely, but I try to stick to local places or chains we don't have at home (in the US) just because I'm curious and always want to try something new. after a long and exhausting day of traveling, sometimes nothing is better than eating takeout on your hotel bed.\n\nthat being said, McDonalds has definitely come through in a pinch before. I was in Amsterdam with terrible acid reflux (drinking too much wine!) and nothing was helping so I dashed into McD's and chugged a milkshake while my friends were eating dinner a few doors down lol",
      "The best McDonald's I've ever eaten was in the Rome train station. I always like to see what fast food is like in other countries.",
      "Hahaha i think i had taco bell in seville too. I just didn't feel like fried food and bread anymore after 5 days so i just slammed some kind of spicy burrito.",
      "My goto comfort food is kebabs/shawarma. Which when it comes to europe, is great since you can get a great one in most major cities. I was in seville couple months ago and highly recommend Bar Alaturca. Great kebab and great value!",
      "Yep, I ate on a dinner twice during my last trip. I even went to a grilled chicken place once.\n\nOf course you need to experience the food of the place, but sometimes, you just want to be fed quickly and cheaply.",
      "I mean, you can basically order from local restaurants on delivery services. I ordered a lot of food and tried a lot of different food on Wolt when I stayed in Crete for 1 month. Same in Thailand and Philippines, just ordering from grab \ud83d\ude02",
      "Like American fast food chains? Not unless I absolutely have to. I can get that shit at home.",
      "I rarely eat fast food but when I\u2019m abroad, I\u2019ll break bad if I just need something else or nothing else is open. The amount of times McD\u2019s has saved me because it was the only place open\u2026 \n\nAlso I don\u2019t feel like crap after because there isn\u2019t all the processed junk we have in the US",
      "Personally, I think it's kind of lame to go McDonald's for a European, Asian, etc. burger when you can get infinitely better versions of whatever is in that burger at the local mom and pop restaurant. But I get why people go:\n\n* It's intimidating to go into a restaurant that doesn't speak English\n\n* Instead of locals judging you (since you are the foreigner), you are instead judging them (since you are the expert in burgers and McDonalds)\n\n* McDonalds reminds you of home when you're in a foreign land\n\n* You already have a good idea of the customs, foods, norms, etc. when ordering and eating there",
      "The only time I eat McDonald\u2019s is abroad. I never eat it in the US. It\u2019s actually real and decent food outside of America.",
      "Closest I\u2019ve come to eating at McDonald\u2019s abroad is ordering a vanilla shake near montmarte in Paris cuz I had to in order to take a piss. Then I went into the one in Porto that is supposed to be the most beautiful Mickey Ds anywhere. But all I did was take some pics. It\u2019s my goal to never eat at a McD or BK ever when traveling.  You only get 3 chances to eat per day so make it count. Especially when traveling to places where there is so much to offer besides our shitty fast food culture.   But to each his own.",
      " Only out of desperation or emergency where I'm starving and nothing else is near by. I'll get local fast food instead of mega chain fast foods. Fast food is already gross as is so if I have to have it I want local fast food at least.",
      "I went to visit my friend in Belgium and I wouldn't have suggested it on my own, but she wanted to eat at a couple of American fast food places (as well as a local chain there) while I was there, so we did. It was different enough from the American versions that it was still an interesting experience. Especially in Belgium, the fry sauce options everywhere made me angry at ketchup when I got back home.",
      "Yeah, sometimes you need a break. Plus, some fast food brands from home have exclusive items elsewhere (like the nasi lemak chicken sandwich at McDonald\u2019s) or there\u2019s a fast food brand I want to try that I don\u2019t get back home. Some days and some meals just have to be easy or I\u2019ll get burned out trying to make every moment amazing.",
      "Yes! But I have Bolt food deliver!",
      "Oh yeah, especially traveling in Malaysia. The craving for western food, like pizza, tacos, and burgers, has been a beast that gets restless about once a week. \n\nI ordered Domino's delivery two nights ago in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "I like trying the local fast food joints! Also, McDonald\u2019s, etc. are sometimes the only places where bathrooms are free to use so i pick up a drink or something to support.",
      "Not really, only when the place I\u2019m at has bad options or has no options. But tbh, McD-Taco Bell-KFC style places is not a common meal I have eaten at home (im not american), so maybe thats why I dont relate to this \u201cfamiliar\u201d part of it. The \u201cfamiliar\u201d food I miss when travelling is very specific and almost non-existent everywhere else outside home, so for me travelling is mostly synonymous with new food experiences",
      "Absolutely, I'm not really interested in food culture or wasting time on going out to eat, so for me grabbing some fast food is the way to go.",
      "Definitely. I always make an effort to try local foods but it's also fun to go to local mcdonald's or other chain restaurants and see the local tweaks to the menu.",
      "I was traveling for about 3 months. Then saw a Taco Bell in Thailand. With all the food I ate, I still wanted Taco Bell. I also ate Burger King in Barcelona and OMG they used some good stuff in their burger.",
      "I do this - but I just want Asian food. I'm also in Spain and like... i like all the seafood and pork but man I just want some Korean food before I have more potatoes and bread . lol",
      "Oh yeah, definitely. Sometimes I'm too lazy to cook especially if I'm the only one eating. I usually cook for the whole family. When I'm alone for a meal, I love ordering food out! And it's pretty satisfying. I get to have a lot of options. And usually, I get my cravings satisfied. My favorites, btw, are fried chicken and pasta!",
      "Always.  Did you know that KFCs in Australia dont have buttermilk biscuits? Or that Austrian McDonald's have (basiclly) breakfast quesadillas. Japanese McDonald's have some great stuff...I'm all in for a full experience wherever I go, and I will almost always hit a fast food spot",
      "Hell yeah, I love trying fast food overseas. Always so many different options, and generally the quality is much better than North America too. Taco Bell in Thailand and Malaysia was delicious!",
      "I gotta fess to eating kfc after two weeks of nothing but traditional food in Japan. I had to sneak it into my hotel. The portions were tiny.",
      "We got McDonald's in the UK and I was like, \"Oh  yay!  It still tastes like cardboard... but with less salt!\"\n\nBut seriously.... You need food to stay alive. Sometimes you just need to fucking eat something.  It doesn't always been to be a whole cultural experience.  Just eat what you want.",
      "I may live in the US, but didn\u2019t grow up here and not a fan of US franchises anyway, so that type of fast food is the last thing I\u2019ll get. If in Europe, I\u2019d rather get bread or pastries, in other areas local street foods, stuff I can\u2019t enjoy in the US",
      "I don't eat fast food at home, so...no. But I get comfort and wanting it.",
      "So I don\u2019t really eat fast food in the States, but when I travel abroad, I always crave burgers and fries and end up going to McDonald's or Burger King.",
      "Definitely, especially because where I'm living currently doesn't have any fast food. The closest fast food is 3 hours away, and even then it's only McDonald's, subway, or burger king. Whenever I have to go there I always make a stop at Mickys",
      "Yes, absolutely. When I travel food is very important to me, I can even do trips planned around food, I only eat local cuisine, I search where to eat in advance, and so on. I even read books about local cuisine in advance to learn more. But the need to get some familiar, comfort food after a while is absolutely normal. Last year I spent 3 weeks in the Norwegian Arctic and after 2 weeks I was craving for vegetables, I'm not vegetarian, but I eat a lot of vegetables, so I was really missing them, in Troms\u00f8 I went to a Lebanese restaurant just to have a vegetarian meal.",
      "In a way it\u2019s also fun to see how different countries do the same thing. Burger King in Istanbul is better than in the states. Istanbul fast food pizza is better than in Lisbon but neither as good as the states. Wouldn\u2019t have known that otherwise!",
      "Depends how much you care about food quality, personally if I am in a place like Sevilla there\u2019s no reason to eat at American fast food joint unless every restaurants are closed",
      "There is no wrong way to travel, but can\u2019t say I ever budge from the local/street food of where I am. Dumb as it sounds I like the challenge of seeing how long I can go without something \u201cwestern\u201d",
      "I've got pretty bad anxiety, so i never go to a sit-down restaurant. I love getting some hand food like a kebab or something, finding a nice scenic spot and eating it there.",
      "Absolutely! Sometimes you need something quick and cheap, or familiar. It\u2019s nice to experience cuisine but locals are also eating at the fast food places.",
      "Don't know if this is a general rule but someone I met while travelling Malaysia told me backpacker rule is that you can get western food every 3 days lol, so every 3 days he'd get some fast food hahaha",
      "I once met this really nice girl on a plane over to Bangkok, we shared a room together and was cool, I liked her. Then we met her friends a couple of days later as they arrived direct from Switzerland. who went straight to KFC ***just*** after landing in Bangkok a city with some of the best food on the planet ... realised her friends were idiots and she wasn't much better.  \n\n\nBUT after being in SE Asia for a month or two, a BK or KFC once in a while is a good reminder of home and a rest from great food for a bit :)",
      "Every now and again I do especially if it's late and night.\n\nSometimes the fast food especially in Germany with the Doner Kebabs and currywurst can be really good.",
      "I was solo in Seville. Boring honestly. But do remember getting decent meals there for cheap. I don't really buy into experiencing the culture when in Europe in terms of food since I'm from there and its not like I can't almost get everything, anywhere. I've no problem with takeaways travelling iow.",
      "I actually go to fast food just to see how different it tastes. Im used to American standards and they are known to add mysterious chemicals and ingredients in their food which is illegal in countries outside of US.\n\nI get curious to see how they make their food with better alternative ingredients in it. But I also find fast food in a lot of countries to be middle-class prices for that reason. Street food is still cheaper than fast food in a lot of countries.",
      "I do, but usually at airports just from convenience. My last meal in France before flying home to the US was at a McDonald's. I'll always make time for KFC when I'm in Hong Kong though because KFC there is crack.\n\nNo shame in eating fast food in other countries. Other countries usually do American fast food better than Americans anyway.",
      "My go-to takeaway/fast food abroad is always a good euro",
      "1000% every new country I visit- I have to go to at least one fast food place.",
      "I did. In fact it was the first time in years I\u2019d eaten fast food simply because I was tired, it was convenient and a bit curious if it tasted any different",
      "This is probably going to get downvoted but even though sometimes I WANT fast food in Europe I\u2019m just too embarrassed to do it. This is a personal problem, but I just imagine everyone staring at me and thinking \u2018Ugh, look at this stereotypical American getting McDonalds in Europe. Of course they would!\u2019 even though I\u2019m sure irl nobody notices or cares. That\u2019s on traveling with anxiety",
      "Lol I've been in Japan for several months and def need a break from the food for some mcdonalds or other fast food. Luckily Japan has a pretty legit burger culture so the burgers are good in general here."

    "selftext": "I mean how much does food actually mean to you when you travel? Obviously we need to eat but how much do you value trying new foods? Do you just eat whatever is available and not think too much about it? I ask this because I meet so many people who find it bizarre if I have a slice of pizza in a place that has such a rich food scene but personally I've never been a massive foodie. I've discovered some amazing new foods such as borscht whilst in Ukraine and the vast majority of Georgian cuisine but it's never make or break for me, Ive met loads of people who may have a lower opinion of a place due to the poor quality of food available. So how much does it affect the overall quality of a trip for you? Is it a massive deal or is it something you don't particularly take into account like myself?",

      "It needs to have food so I don\u2019t die.",
      "It's the first thing I research *after* I pick a destination. I won't avoid a place because food is bad, but it is the thing I most look forward to when I travel. And as another comment said, it can make me negatively view a country - I liked Cuba, but the food was terrible that I now don't look back fondly on that trip.",
      "Huge deal for me. Cuba was in part a disappointment because the food was just awful. The culture didn't work for me, but the food was a nail in the coffin. I travel to eat and experience new things, but Cuba felt like trying to avoid salt by the end of it!",
      "Food is a huge part of travel for me. Like another commenter said, it can be the final straw in deciding whether you enjoy yourself somewhere. I love food and trying new things when I\u2019m home, so I value that even more so when I travel. I don\u2019t need amazing food to enjoy myself, but I do really value places with excellent food scenes/options. The best meal I ate in Zimbabwe was at a food stall owned by a woman who cooked local veggies and grains- not groundbreaking, but absolutely delicious, which gave me such a wonderful memory.",
      "It's the main reason I travel.  I spend a good amount of time before each trip researching regional dishes I need to try, as well as the best places in the area to find them. Focus is definitely smaller local places over luxury or fine dining.  \n  \nNow I don't need a country to be on the level of India, Mexico, or Italy in terms of food to have a good time, but I do find the food scene often reflects the country's broader feel.  For example, I didn't enjoy Costa Rica because it felt so Americanized, and the food scene being dominated by U.S  chains or resort/tourist joints played a big part in that. But I've also enjoyed other countries that don't have the best reputation for their cuisine.  \n  \nObviously not everyone needs to be a foodie and do thorough culinary research when traveling, but I've always felt that food is the most immediately visible way to experience a culture (we all have to eat, right?). Travelers who go out of their way to avoid sampling the local cuisine, be it backpackers who stick to hostel pancakes and burgers or business travelers who won't go below fine dining level, are doing both themselves and their destination a huge disservice.",
      "It's like anything else. If food is one of your hobbies, you'll prioritize food when you travel. If, I dunno, hiking or motorcycling or photography or skydiving or architecture or 12th century poetry are your hobbies, you'll prioritize those things.",
      "It's one of the primary drivers when I'm picking somewhere to visit, plus food tours are just generally a fantastic way of getting grounded in a city.",
      "It's not that big of a deal to me. I'm a vegetarian and I don't expect the world to cater to me so I'm often just happy if I can find a balanced meal while traveling. I didn't really like the food in Cambodia or Panama, for instance, but I enjoyed visiting both of those countries very much.\n\nI do really like both cooking and eating so if I can find good food I'll be especially delighted but it's not always easy. And food doesn't make or break it - India is a great place to eat for vegetarians and I fucking love Indian food but it's such a difficult destination in every other sense that the food doesn't compensate. \n\nOf every place I've been I think the country with the best combination of great (meat-free) food options and great stuff to do is Turkey.",
      "It's one of my main reasons to travel. I will stay in a $10 hostel, spend 2 days travelling by bus instead of trains or flights to save money, but will splurge several hundreds on a good meal. Most of the time, my food budget alone is double or triple the budget of everything else: transportation, accommodation, etc...",
      "Food is one of the best and easiest ways to connect with local culture.  I love trying new foods, and for me it is a cornerstone of travel.  \n\nThat being said, there are other ways to get the real feels of the places you visit.  Those real feels, those distinct ways of looking at the world, are what travel is all about.",
      "I guess I'm a foodie in that when I visit a place,  I want to try the local foods.  I'm not a refined connoisseur type of foodie with high standards for every meal (beef must be grass fed, of excellent cuts and tender!).  I like to hit restaurants of various quality and street food.\n\nBut I also enjoy trying cousine from people not from that area.  I remember reading a blog by a Greek for people visiting Greece, talking about the wonders of Greece and with info about every thing to do, see and experience plus travel tips and warnings. \n\n He made an interesting point that has influenced my travels.  He asked himself a rhetorical question:  \"Would I go to a Greek Restaurant in Rio?\" \"Hell, yes\".  His thought was not to experience perfectly authentic Greek food, he could get that at home (you call that Tzatziki! It's not authentic Tzatziki like what my dear old grandmother made back in the village only using the finest local yogurt, herded by authentic local shepherds !).  He wanted to see how Greek food was translated by the place.  Immigrants are influenced by local foods, spices, and tastes and he would be curious as hell on seeing how those things resulted in *Brazilian Greek food.*  \n\nAs well, before going to a place, I look up local junk foods, candy and interesting stuff to find at the grocery store.  People everywhere in the world need to shop and part of having an \"authentic\" experience is to see what the regular folks buy at the grocery store and eat.  \n\nAnd so I tried T\u00far\u00f3 Rudi in Budapest and when I learned I really liked it, I tried different brands.  I got several packets of mastiha gum in Athens.  The ancient Greeks chewed it - it's the original chewing gum! \n\nI always look up and try the region's version of chocolate.  Countries further north are known for the best chocolate and I didn't have high expectation for Pavlidis or Ion in Athens but really enjoyed Pavlidis.  Plus it has a cool wrapper.  \n\nSo I'm a foodie but not a highfalutin foodie.",
      "Yuge. The trip to Italy is worth it for the food alone.",
      "One of the most important aspects for me but if you\u2019re not super into food then I guess it wouldn\u2019t matter as much.",
      "I like good food, but I am not traveling for the sake of food.  \n\nWhat is important to me is that I experience local food.  I would like to experience the authenticity of the local cuisine, rather than how good it tastes.  I want to taste what the locals are eating, good or bad.  \n\nI'd rather have authentic food which does not taste too well, rather than food that is made for tourists that approximates something that reminds them of home.\n\nBut, yeah, if I am on the run, and I just want a quick bite, sure I'll pop in to grab a Big Mac at McDonald's.",
      "I constantly claim I\u2019m in no way a foodie, and I\u2019ve always found foodiesm a little bit trite and \u201clame\u201d... I\u2019m a little bit older than most of the demo here, but young enough to not be a grandpa (40), so I remember the sorta recent past where hanging out meant a chain diner, shitty coffee, and cigarettes.  If you asked me or my friends in the 90s to go on a foodie tour of Denmark sweets you\u2019d have come off as insane.  I travel a lot, I\u2019ve lived in Europe and Asia, and it\u2019s funny... their accounts of similar time frame recall it was better when \u201cAmericans were simple and used to shitty food coffee and beer...they had zero complaints and were woo\u2019d by the simplest things.\u201d  \n\nMy friend who owns a bar in Berlin said he now fears Americans in a different way - now he presents them with unique vintage German beers and they come back with \u201cthis is gross, my local brewpub in Brooklyn has a variant of this strain imported from your country, that they organically and sustainably grown on the rooftop, and it\u2019s hoppier and more deep, LIKE IT SHOULD BE - we have the journals...\u201d.   He said it was actually better when Americans had Miller light and Salisbury steak tastes.",
      "\"Good food\" isn't something that concerns me at all when choosing a travel destination. I'm not picky or adventurous, a carb, beans/lentils or meat, and a vegetable is enough to satisfy me. That describes a lot of national cuisines. Although it's a turn-off to me to visit a place like Iceland or  USA where it can be hard to find a balanced meal for cheap.",
      "Couldn\u2019t care less usually. I do love Indian food, so always happy to be there and eat endless Thalis, but it\u2019s not the reason to go anywhere.\n\nFor me, food is just fuel. I\u2019m the kind of person who occasionally forgets to eat at all, because my hunger reflex is really not very strong. I\u2019ve done multi day hikes where I just don\u2019t eat some days and it doesn\u2019t seem to affect me as long as I have enough water.\n\nBut I do those hikes with a friend of mine who is the opposite and gets cranky as hell if he doesn\u2019t eat multiple times a day. Everyone\u2019s different I guess.",
      "Food is the most important part of a trip for me. Money spent on mediocre food means I wasted a meal and those are limited since I only eat a maximum of two meals a day. Cuba and Colombia are two places that I have been wanting to go to but I hear the food is horrible in both of those locations and that has definitely made me hesitant to plan trips there. I\u2019m just a fan of good food; the type of cuisine doesn\u2019t really matter to me. I\u2019ve had some amazing pizza in Mexico, for example, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll eat only Mexican food just because I\u2019m in Mexico.",
      "My brother is of your opinion, and its why I don't travel with him anymore. I understand YOU don't think food is a big deal and want to focus on other stuff. But for me I got so miserable on trips he planned because it felt like I missed out on half the culture and experience on visiting places because we would see a bunch of churches and get Mc Donalds for meals. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt just felt hollow.",
      "Unimportant. \n\nI\u2019m not a foodie and I never will be. Cooking and trying exotic cuisines are simply none of my interests. My goal is to fill my stomach and meet my daily nutritional needs. It matters not if I eat the same things over and over. I particularly don\u2019t like street food because it\u2019s usually unhealthy. \n\nI\u2019m more of a history, museum, and architecture person.",
      "I think you can find good food anywhere. its a part of the experience trying new food. i didn't know of shan noodle soup before going to Myanmar but it is one of my favorite foods now. Embrace the country and what it has to offer and you are sure to have a fulfilling experience.",
      "It's a huge thing for me, one bad meal won't break or make your trip (unless you get food poisoning) but a good meal can really elevate your entire experience. And I'm not necessarily talking $12 appetizer plates at a fancy wine bar - it could be drunk street tacos at 2am or a soup whose name you can't pronounce on a cold rainy day. When I plan a trip I look up the top reviewed restaurants in the area and try to go to a fancier one and a lot of smaller cafes or bars, and I genuinely plan whole days around the restaurants I want to experience. I'm a big time cook at home too so I'm definitely biased!",
      "Every place you go will have good food. Just a matter of finding it and paying for it. In some countries good food is more accessible, while other places you have to get lucky.",
      "It depends on what country I'm in. For example, when I was in Norway, I was more into seeing the nature than the food...this all being said, I like seafood a lot, so I bought fish and cooked it myself, and that was the best fish I've ever had!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't travel specifically for food but I do like exploring markets, buying and cooking from local ingredients, and eating \"every day food.\" Nothing fancy, just what people tend to eat. And local food is something that varies too...I don't necessarily go to the Netherlands to eat Dutch food but I will immediately look for an Indonesian restaurant (since they have a strong community there).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mainly like food because it tends to tell a deeper story about a region and I find that kind of fascinating.",
      "Not a big concern for me. I\u2019m very picky when it comes to eating I guess. \n\nI\u2019ve had meals with so many spices and textures to it that I just couldn\u2019t enjoy it personally.\n\nBefore visiting Georgia I had heard many great things about the food, but truth be told, it was probably the most disappointing country I\u2019ve visited so far in terms of food, except for Iceland, of course with Iceland I knew it would be bad for food in advance (especially since I hate seafood).",
      "I think food is huge part of the culture. I feel like if you miss the food it\u2019s the same like if you miss the architecture of the place. Going to the local restaurant having their food and some local drinks that\u2019s what makes me feel more connected to the people. Sometimes it happens that you end up eating something not good, but most of the time you just have a small explosion of joy in your mouth that you never felt before. \nAnd if I feel like missing the place I just find their restaurant in my city and I feel immediately closer to the place. It\u2019s amazing... in my opinion it\u2019s better than taking photos. Plus if you hang out with locals they sometimes reveal their cooking secrets and you get home and you can actually cook it yourself. Every time I get home from travel a unpack bunch of new spices and I cry because their food is always better than ours!",
      "I like to eat some of the local cuisine when I travel but usually I don't think much about it, I just search for some 3-5 restaurants, eat there and I'm fine, the rest of the time I just eat stuff from supermarkets or even McDonald's/burger King as it's very cheap and I always travel on a budget. I'm more interested in history and architecture than food, even if it's part of the history",
      "SO IMPORTANT!!! How can you experience a culture without experiencing their food? \n\nA country\u2019s foods and delicacies really affect the way I see the country and learn about their culture.\n\nSome foods are only eaten at certain ceremonies, like how different is Christmas without that Christmas dinner. These foods end up being so important to these ceremonies and it\u2019s just wrong without them - sometimes they even influence traditions. \n\nFood is also a reflection of the county and it\u2019s beliefs, virtues and history. I\u2019ve just visited Oman and their vegetation is rich with date trees, it\u2019s a really typical welcome to arrive and be offered dates with Omani coffee. I honestly didn\u2019t go anywhere without this being offered to me, it\u2019s such a huge part of their culture and it shows how welcoming, hospitable and generous their culture is. Dates were also one of their biggest exports so it really helped with their economic growth years ago.  (On top of frankincense and oil) \n\nOr even look at the Japanese and their great skin conditions and younger looking faces, I think this has much to do with their seaweed heavy diet, seaweed has amazing properties for skin regeneration.\n\nI\u2019ve also learnt so much about foods containing health properties, I mean before modern medicine we used what the land offered us and some cultures continue to do this (and this still works!!) it\u2019s not just fascinating learning about cultures and history, but you also learn really valuable information for personal use. \n\nI really think food makes a big part of culture, you can\u2019t fully experience a culture without experiencing their food. \nFood constantly brings people together day after day, for so many different reasons, so basically YA\u2019LL NEED TO START EATING WHEN YOU TRAVEL!",
      "Gonna give it to you straight. I'm what they used to call pleasingly plump in other words straight up I'm fat. When I travel I always seek out food experiences. One of my favorite things to do before a trip is check out what unusual foods there are to try where I am visiting. I always check out any episodes of Bizarre Foods for the area I'll be visiting and try to visit some of the places. It has led to me trying all sorts of wonderful foods and drinks everywhere I've gone. If I don't eat in at least one place where I'm the only non-local partaking that day, I don't feel my trip is a success.",
      "I'm not a foodie by nature - I eat to survive, so I won't feel like it's a loss if I don't try everything in a new place I go to. I don't research on food before I travel; I'll usually ask the hotel front desk for recommendations. \n\nHeck, I even eat McDonald's when I'm overseas.",
      "  so many people who find it bizarre if I have a slice of pizza in a place that has such a rich food scene\n\nhaha, I'm probably one of those people! \n\nThe food scene isn't a big factor to me when planning travel, but once a trip is booked a research the \"must eat\" foods and try to avoid food that i could find back home or in other parts of the world.",
      "It's a big deal to me because it's such an easy and fun way to learn about a place's culture! It's also a great way to connect with people either from that country or friends that have also travelled to the same place. It seems like in most countries the kitchen or dinner table is the primary social gathering place, so food becomes a huge part of most every culture. Exploring traditional foods in a new place can teach you so much and you.might discover a new food you love that you'd never have had the chance to discover back home!",
      "It\u2019s not super simple. I absolutely love food and some of my favorite spots to travel are partly because the food is so good. Like Bangkok, Mexico City, NYC. However, I ate what was quite literally the best food I have ever had in my life in Beijing...but I kind of hated Beijing and wouldn\u2019t go back on purpose. OTOH, I\u2019ve spent 3 months in Iceland on 3 different trips and the time I\u2019ve spent there is extremely important to me... and they have some of the worst food I\u2019ve ever eaten.",
      "Literally 0. I eat food like I shit, as part of human nature. Sometimes I'll have a nice shit, sometimes I'll have a nice steak. Trying stuff I've never eaten before can be fun and cool, but I have as much enjoyment comparing fast food from around the world. All in all, like other commenters have said as well, I plan everything else first, then I consider food. If there's a cool, unique, or highly rated place, maybe I'll check it out. If I don't have time or the budget, no big deal",
      "I'm pretty much a refueler.  I like having something tasty at mealtime, but I just don't care about the foodie thing.  For one thing, I find no enjoyment in fancy restaurants by myself.  I'd just as soon have a ham-and-cheese croissant at a bakery, or a d\u00f6ner kebab and a beer.",
      "Omg I totally agree with you! Most travellers I know are massive foodies and I just can\u2019t get into it. Interesting food is cool, but I don\u2019t research the best places to eat or anything.",
      "I did a bunch of European countries this year and most of the time I bought groceries for the day and then cooked back at the hostel. I'd rather save money and extend my trip or have it for museums. Food is important, but I can cook anything I want to eat at home. I travel for the things I see and can do while I'm abroad. I do OMAD so I see food differently than most people.",
      "I often choose destinations (e.g. Georgia, Malaysia, Thailand) for the food alone.",
      "I'm the same as you. I decided to travel solo partly because of this. First time I went to Tokyo I went with three friends, all kind of rich, and a couple of them had their whole day planned around food. They were not interested in walking around and just looking at stuff. They grudgingly went to Yoyogi Park and on that day, it was unseasonably warm so lots of people were there. I wanted to walk around. Two of them wanted to go to an eel place in Ginza before it was too late. I told them to go without me, I'd meet up with them later, and they passive aggressively said they'd walk around. I could tell they weren't happy. In my mind, that was when I realized I can't travel with other people. People were doing dance routines, playing sports, singing with guitars, etc, all around the park, and I could tell they did NOT want to be walking. And they just wanted to eat. I don't judge people for being foodies, but I'm just not that person. I feel like if I travel alone, it's a victimless crime. Nobody has to be mad at me for stopping them from hitting a restaurant they read about. I just like to get lost, walk around, and if I see something decent, I'll try it.",
      "Honestly, not important at all. I appreciate if there is cheap, easily accessible food, but it\u2019s not going to affect my decision of where to go",
      "Honestly, very very little.\n\nIf there is a dish that genuinely looks nice, or is a twist on a food I already like, I'll try it. But normally I just stick to what I like, and avoid getting myself sick. \n\nI spent a few weeks in China last year with no option but to eat local cuisine, and most of it was pretty bad. I also good food poisoning from it. Then I spent a week in Hong Kong and probably went to McDonalds about 15 times..\n\nWhich was probably silly because there was lots of nice looking food there. Guess i was just so distraught after mainland China that I needed it lol \n\nAlthough I am a sucker for trying all sorts of new candy, soda, and treats!",
      "If it's edible then that's fine by me. When I see YouTube travel content focus on food, I think well there must be very little to see and do.",
      "It\u2019s almost the most important thing I look at. If it\u2019s a city, I love walking around and trying the food. That\u2019s why I loved Istanbul and loved Ireland for the views but the food was terrible. \n\nMexico City was by far the worst place for food.",
      "I feel like that if you're going to a larger city and can't find good food, you're doing something wrong. Hundreds of thousands of people live there, and they all have to eat. So I do look forward to food, but I've never been to a huge city without having great food.\n\nIf we're talking about small towns, then a certain restaurant or type of food might attract me there, but it wouldn't be the main focus of the trip. Again, most of the time you just have to look, use the internet, and maybe travel a little further to find good food.",
      "I was in China once for 3 weeks. I had 2 weeks of authentic Chinese food. The third week there, I found myself at a place that had a lot of backpackers, and a few westerners had opened up restaurants there. I had cereal and yogurt for breakfast, and it was so freaking good.\n\nI will enjoy the local food scene, but some familiar food occasionally is comforting.",
      "Not a huge foodie usually but I am when I travel. Experiencing new foods and attitudes towards food is part of the experience for me, and I make it a point to splurge on at least one local meal when I go somewhere, despite usually being very frugal towards food. And I also enjoy the opportunity to get local snacks or condiments or something that I can enjoy back home.",
      "I think your comment about not being a foodie is the most relevant one. For people to whom food is little more than fuel a country's food scene will mean little. \n\nI've been a foodie for as long as I can remember. I cook (quite well, I'm told), I read about food, I'm interested in the effect food has on history and culture and so, when I travel, food influences my travel choices a great deal. \n\nWhatever you're into, happy travels.",
      "Massively for me. I essentially do food travel which is a niche on its own that more and more people are becoming interested in total. If you think of food as an extension of a country's culture, history, socio-economical and political situation, it becomes incredibly interesting. I find that food also provides insights into the psyche of a region. If you can scratch beyond the superficial level of taste and price, then it becomes a whole lot more interesting.",
      "It's super important for me.\n\nI'm a decent cook. I can make a fair amount of food and have it taste good. If I'm going somewhere new, I want to eat something new that I couldn't make at home (or something that I could make at home but didn't know about until I saw it on the menu).\n\nA family friend went to England and refused to eat anything other than cheeseburgers. I don't want to limit myself like that. That's not to say that if it's been a long day and I just need calories before I pass out I won't go for a burger or a pizza, but given the choice I'll try to branch out and try something new.",
      "It's nice to have but it isn't a deal breaker for me. \n\nI've been to the Philippines twice and it has been the worst country food wise for me a vegetarian. But it's such a beautiful country with lovely people that I don't care that much about the food.",
      "I actually have a lot of anxiety about food when I travel. It's one of the things that keeps me from enjoying myself. I have food allergies, so I can't just eat whatever is available. I won't starve, but I just spend way too much time worrying about it. I'm older now and don't need as many calories, so at least I'm not as hungry as I used to be.",
      "Food scene? How about the BEER SCENE?!",
      "I don\u2019t research a destinations food scene beforehand but I do try to find out what foods are popular when I arrive and try to taste a few of the cultures foods. I usually end up finding a type of food or restaurant I really like and keep going back. And I make a point of trying McDonald\u2019s in every country I visit (if available) because it\u2019s always interesting to me how it\u2019s different everywhere I go!",
      "It depends, honestly.  Why am I going there?  If my main purpose is to go on a specific hike that I've found, then I'll go even if the food is not supposed to be very good.  If I'm going to see some architectural marvel, some cultural artefact, or just to explore a new country, the food can suck and I'll still go.\n\nOf course, the better the food, the better the trip!  I'm a bit of a foodie, and I love trying new foods, so culinary delights are always a big part of my trip.  \n\nI have yet to come across a country that had food I hated.  Even when the food was simply \"meh\", each country I've visited had enough local culinary pecularities to keep my stomach happy.  Like for instance in Chile we ate a bunch of hot dogs.  Delicious!  Other than that Chilean cuisine doesn't seem that amazing to me, but I was there to go on a big hike in Patagonia, so I wasn't really focusing on the food.  But even so, the pisco, the hot dogs, the other local dishes..  it was enough to make the trip more interesting.\n\nNot to pick on Chile or anything, but..  other than that...  I suppose Nepal was another country where the food didn't really \"pop\".  But I did love those momos!  And all the stuff we ate in the teahouses on our hike to Everest Basecamp.\n\nSo IMO a country's cuisine can elevate a trip..  but it can never ruin it.  Even if the food is average or meh, I'm likely there for another reason.  So I'll still have a good time",
      "It's a great bonus if the food is particularly good, but not make or break for me.\n\nWorst food I've had was probably in the Baltics, but I still really enjoyed that trip.",
      "Zero. Not a foodie. And I can\u2019t stand spending so much time indoors when there\u2019s so much to see outside. Also vegetarian. I remember going to Spain and eating roadside falafel sandwiches for all my meals because it was quick and I got better things to do and things to see.",
      "For me the food is a bonus\nLike I\u2019m not gonna not visit Colorado, just because the food is shit. I\u2019ll get over it.",
      "If there's good food I will definitely eat it and be adventurous. I would never plan a trip around food though, it's pretty far down the list of things that are important. I'm cheap and end up eating from grocery stores and markets 90% of the time when I travel international.\n\n\nNorway is probably my favorite country I've been to. If you made a graph of all the food in the world, Norwegian cuisine would be somewhere between British food and cardboard. Food just isn't that important.",
      "It\u2019s not my priority when traveling either. I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m a picky eater in general. If someone recommends it, of course I\u2019ll try it.. if it\u2019s within my standards. Lol. \n\nWhat do you prioritize when you travel if it\u2019s not for the food?\n\nGlad I\u2019m not alone. Thanks for sharing! \u2728",
      "Have no interest in it at all, I'm happy to just eat at the big chains (McDonald's, Subway etc). I know what I like from them, it's an easy order regardless of any language barrier, and it's an affordable price within a daily budget. The only times I try out any local foods or restaurants is when I'm with someone from the hostel and they want to try it, I'm meeting with a friend from the place I'm visiting, or I'm at a train/bus station and none of the big chains are available.",
      "I eat the weirdest local food if they serve it to regulars. Camel meat, goats brains, sperm sushi and dirty river fish sandwich( Turkey).\n\nAvoid touristy foods like pork knuckles",
      "Food is important to me only when I already like the cuisine, or find that I like it once I\u2019m there. I did a lot of foodie tourism in Thailand because back home I eat Thai food all the time, I love the stuff. But Eastern Europe is still one of my favorite regions even though I don\u2019t care for the meat heavy + limited veggies thing most of the cuisines there have going on. Depends where I\u2019m going.",
      "As long as I don't have the same thing twice (unless it's super regional and blew my mind away), I'm down with whatever.  \n\n\nI'm out for new experiences, and the includes the food. If the food totally sucks, then well... that's part of the experience!",
      "It\u2019s just one of the factors. It\u2019s really nice when a destination has great food, but it won\u2019t make or break the trip.\n\nA couple of my favorite destinations had some of the lousiest food I\u2019ve ever eaten. That said, if the people suck, I at least want good eats.",
      "Extremely. I only have a couple of hobbies - food and reading. So.",
      "It\u2019s pretty important to me because when I\u2019m on vacation, the food is part of the entire experience. The best ramen I\u2019ve ever had was in Amsterdam of all places and it\u2019s still one of the first things I remember when I think about that trip. Even though I live in a very diverse city with amazing food, I can\u2019t get the addicting street tacos from Mexico City here or street food from Thailand. So I try to soak everything up when I\u2019m abroad. That said, I have yet to visit a country whose food I did not enjoy. Definitely visited a few places that were misses but with google reviews and the like, it\u2019s pretty easy to find good places to eat at.",
      "I love food, trying new cuisines, and enjoying what I cannot get at home. Sure, I adore history, museums, people, and just being someplace new, but food is a window into other worlds. Street food, home cooking, restaurants, it's all interesting. \n\nWhen I was little, we moved a lot, and I  was fascinated by the differences as we drove cross-country. Pancakes and flapjacks and griddle cakes! I was seven.  Mom told me I had to take a bite of everything, if I didn't like it, I didn't have to eat it. I still remember the day I  tried sweet and sour pork. I became a foodie right then.  Dad retired from the Navy not long after, and took us to Japan and Europe. Frommer's Europe on $5 a Day.  Finding good inexpensive food was a thing.  \nI am old and slower now, food is an accessible pleasure.",
      "If I don't like the food scene I won't return, but it's not really a factor when first deciding to visit.",
      "I won't turn down trying new food but i don't go out of my way to find the authentic food. I often just do grab-n-go",
      "My first month of backpacking I found myself in a \u201cchallenging\u201d food country (for me at least) and spent the first month pretty much eating only familiar fast food and pastries. \n\nI regret that so much and food is actually a big part of my travel now. I want to be out of my comfort zone and will purposefully order things that I\u2019m not sure about or are unfamiliar with. If I\u2019m in an area notable for d\u00e9gustation I\u2019ll spend the money to eat at a nice restaurant. Or eat the weird street food. When I go to a new place I\u2019ll look up some foods / meals they\u2019re known for and make it a point to try some. It adds a lot more excitement and memory to a trip. And I\u2019ve found some new things I really like!",
      "Food scene is one of the factors that I use to decide where I want to visit, and I try to take a food tour or a cooking class in every country I visit. IMO food is the best vehicle to experience culture. The foods that are available in a certain country/region can tell you so much about the economics, history, culture, and personality of a country. I love Cajun food, and Cajun food tells the story of creole culture in New Orleans/Louisiana. You go to Vietnam - home of arguably the best fusion cuisine of all time - all of their cuisine is an artifact from the French colonization in the 19th century. Sushi in Japan reflects not just how reliant Japan is on the ocean, but also how the craftsmanship that goes into everything the Japanese do.\n\nAs far as finding something I like, I'll try almost anything, unless it's unethically sourced or the vendor looks sketch (example - I'm very wary of street food vendors in Vietnam).\n\nThe one thing I do really like is having an American breakfast where ever I go. I just find it really helpful to start my day with coffee, eggs, and a protein. It's been pretty easy to find everywhere I've visited, except Japan. I tried a traditional Japanese breakfast, and it wasn't for me. The rest of my trip I'd get gas station coffee and some soba for breakfast. Wasn't ideal, but it was fine.\n\nThat said, not every meal has fine dining. One of my best meals abroad was a beef stew in North Ireland. One of my worst meals was a Kaiseki in Japan.",
      "I wanted to eat the local cuisine, but I personally found German food nasty. I ate at McDonalds a couple times and felt ashamed",
      "Good food is essential to me for travel enjoyment.  The lack of decent food in Taipei has me sitting in my hotel room eating cup-o-noodles from the Carrefour right now as we speak.",
      "Food is SUPER important to me because I just love eating and trying new things! I look for destinations that are vegan friendly (bc I am vegan ahah) and do a ton of research about food, culture, and restaurants before going somewhere. I went to China this past summer and had no problem being vegan there. Lots of vegetable dishes, especially tofu and eggplant, which is great! I remember getting vegan street noodles for 50 cents in Shanghai. So yummy. \n\nI did get tired of Chinese food towards the end of my trip, but struggled to find vegan food from a different ethnic cuisine, so I kinda just pushed through and when I arrived back in the states, ate one giant sandwich from Ike's sandwiches.",
      "It's not the number 1 priority, but I'm happier if I can easily find and fill my stomach with good food. It'll make an OK trip a good one, and a good trip to an amazing one.",
      "Somewhat. But it's not a deal breaker.\n\nI will admit I'm a bit of a Foodie and love cooking and trying new foods and cuisine. But I also love things like beautiful scenery and culture when I'm travelling. \n\nSome of my favourite destinations have been places with great food, which certainly helped make it a 'better' destination to travel (Sri Lanka, Georgia, Italy, Greece), but I have also loved places not renowned for their food (Scotland, England, Wales, Czech Republic). In fact, Wales probably had the worst food (sorry Wales) but I still enjoyed it there because the people were so friendly.\n\n I wasn't a fan of Czech food, but still loved my time there (I think because the awesome beer made up for it).",
      "Imperative, went to the Caribbean and was horrified that the hotels got first choice of pretty much everything imported. Needless to say food was shit, overpriced and damn near off everywhere but the hotels. Cost of a big standard meal at a hotel 75 USD per person. EXCLUDING DRINKS. Done with the Caribbean",
      "Food is tremendously important for me, but it doesn't come first. I'll go to a place for scenery/culture or particular activities (diving or coffee roasting workshops for example), but once there I'll do my best to get a balanced impression of the local food.",
      "I get most excited for food lol. I will never go back to Hungary because I hated the food there.",
      "It's not the most important part, but it is an important part. And the quality of the local cuisine, especially the street food scene, will either enhance or diminish my experience.",
      "I'm a bit of a foodie and like to cook.  I've spent a fair bit of time looking for restaurants Anthony Bordain reviewed or Michelin starred ones.  Usually take a day for a cooking class and try to buy a cookbook of local cuisine in English if I can find it for a souvenir.   Memories of trips stand out a lot because of food, snails in Morrocco, sushi at the Tokyo fish market, Portugese pasteis de nata, etc.  There is a certain point that it's not worth the $ or I'm just not interested or have the time.  I ate an awful lot of noodles and 7-11 salads in Japan because I got back after 11pm and didn't want to shell out huge money for a meal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree with everyone that Cuba is mostly a disappointment, we did find quite a few decent places as compared to 10yrs ago though, and fresh caught shrimp and lobster makes up for a lot.  Even Germany and Austria I found myself bored of all the meat and potatoes, maybe because of a large German population where I'm from, but schnitzel is not exciting.",
      "I\u2019ve been to many countries. Food is pretty much the same everywhere. Different tastes and textures but pretty much the same. I\u2019m fine no matter where I go. Food isn\u2019t that much of a concern for me. My bigger concern is whether the place has any good museums.",
      "I choose my travel destinations based on their cuisine. I keep going back to Turkey and trying different regions each time because I can\u2019t get enough of their food. I don\u2019t seek particular restaurants but always make sure to seek out a particular food or specialty in places I visit there. \n\nI went to Ethiopia last year because I like their food (we have a number of restaurants in Southern California). However I probably won\u2019t go again because I didn\u2019t really like the food culture. They don\u2019t have street food (coffee and popcorn don\u2019t really count), most of their snack foods are imports I can find at Arab markets, and the Ethiopian dishes at restaurants weren\u2019t that good. It was pretty disappointing.",
      "Good, unique grub is a cherry on top of a good trip, but I eat to live, not the other way around. And if I'm gonna spontaneously splurge on something, food's not first on the list. In fact if I have access to a kitchen I'll often just cook for myself, but I'm usually on a budget. Street food can be a good way to get the local vibe, as long as you avoid deep-fried stuff or anything else you might regret the next day. But mediocre food doesn't taint my visit in hindsight at all. e.g. most Puerto Rican food is absolute trash but that doesn't taint my visit there.",
      "I'n a vegetarian (so no meat, fish, eggs, milk) so I can't eat a lot of local foods anyway. I don't care much, I do it because I don't want to participate in animal abuse and slaughter. I do have the best time exploring local vegan and veggie restaurants, which are increasingly upcoming basically everywhere in the world.",
      "Food is food",
      "It\u2019s one of the last things I think of when I travel. I usually end up just getting food at the convenience store.",
      "I love checking out the food scene in terms of local dishes, food culture, snacks (street food is soooo good in so many countries) and markets. I really love going to markets to see what produce locals are buying and to supermarkets to see all the random sauces etc.. food is a huge highlight of my trips! I wouldn't rule out a country cos it isn't known strongly for food but wherever I am I'd check out what is available",
      "Im going to go against the grain here and say its truthfully not that important when it comes to my trips. What matters most to me is the historical sites, cultural activities, experiences, etc. Dont get me wrong, I like to experience local food but its not something I go ham for. It's more of a bonus than a focal point.",
      "Having an interesting food culture is one of the things I look forward to when visiting a country so much so that when I start researching for a trip the first thing I do is look at YouTube videos for food reviews. \n\nThere're a few channels I like and follow; if they have good reviews that makes me want to mark those places and visit them myself. If not there's a good chance I will prioritize another country or go back to someplace I've already been. \n\nMy Google Maps has little stars of all the good food places I've visited and enjoyed, and flags for those I've yet to visit or visited and found to be average.",
      "i like trying new foods and it's definitely one thing i enjoy about going to a new place, but in some places, the food just sucks. and even if it doesn't, sometimes you just want something easy and familiar, especially if you have been on the road a while. people who get all high and mighty about you needing to eat local food at all times while traveling are a pain in my ass. \n\nActual conversation from when I was in mexico. (I was transitioning between locations so i was in a hostel for a couple days).\n\nRandom guy: did you have a good night? what did you do for dinner?\n\nMe: yeah, my night was good. I went to a great burger place.\n\nRando: starts some long rant about how could you possibly eat a burger while in mexico and how i'm just wasting my trip by avoiding all the great local food and i should just stay home if i'm not going to enjoy the local culture.\n\nMe: :|\n\nMe: that's one theory. so, how long have you been traveling?\n\nrando: (puffs out chest) almost a month. I have 2 more months on the road.\n\nme: wow, that's a long trip. should be fun. but once you get to 9 years on the road, like i have been, you'll realize that sometimes you don't want local food. because this isn't a vacation, this is life. and what you won't want is some wannabe Anthony Bourdain lecturing you about how to eat while you live your life. if i was on vacation, like you, i'd stick to local foods. but after almost a decade, sometimes i just want a fucking burger.",
      "I am all for trying out local cuisine. However, I only like what I like and food isn't that important to me. In fact, after a week or two of long term travel, I tend to look for restaurants that serve American style cuisine or other ethnic cuisine than the target country as I get fairly tired of the food offerings. Hasn't been that big of an issue as most countries I visit have wide variety of food available.",
      "It's not top of mind for me. Mostly because I have lived in metropolitan cities like NYC, Toronto, Vancouver etc. where I can enjoy any cuisine in any given week. I'm more interested in the scenery, landscapes, safety, the people, the cultural aspects of a destination. Food is the last thing on my mind. Having said, naturally, I would prefer amazing cuisine to bad cuisine. But usually most of my time  during travel is spent seeing new things,  walking all day or engaging in activities, and with grabbing little bites to eat here and there.",
      "In North America it's very important to me. Thankfully in most of the major cities in US and Canada there is a good food scene. I'll look up restaurants that I want to go to in advance and if it's a 30-40min drive there it's not a big deal to me. I like Mexican food so I don't really have any challenges there. \n\n\nWhen I visit a new country I want to try their local cuisine at least once. If I don't like it worst case scenario I eat at McDonald's but at least I've opened myself up to a new experience. \n\nThat being said if I know that I'm going to love the food somewhere, I'm more likely to want to go there. If you eat bland food that part of the day is always going to be something you dread",
      "It\u2019s very important and I usually do a lot of research on food before choosing the destination.",
      "Giant deal!!! I fucking loved Costa Rica and my experience but there was nothing special about their food, other than the fresh fruit. I\u2019m interested in eating my heart out in Portugal.",
      "I'm vegan, so the main priority when it comes to food is that there's something available. I'm happy to just eat small things here and there instead of full meals if it's easier.",
      "It's actually the least important thing for me. I don't usually research the food in the countries I go to, I just kind of assume the food will already be better than where I'm from so I don't put too much thought into it.",
      "Food is a major part of traveling's appeal, but that doesn't mean every meal has to be something new/unique/local. You wanna try that piece of pizza? Go for it. Who knows, there still could be something unique about it. You want to try a McDonald's in every country you visit? It's your trip, do whatever the hell you want.",
      "It's the most important thing for me whilst travelling because I'm a foodie but also because it's very tied into the cultural makeup of a place. It's a different type of experience, unique tastes and smells and often where you eat brings the noise and the visual as well. In a lot of places it's social as well, more so than sightseeing I've found.",
      "I travel for food, love anything that has to do with food.\n\nWhen I travelled full time, I had a blog (when that was still a thing), about the food and culture of each country I visited.\n\nI food and culture are intertwined, I can't see appreciating one without the other.",
      "I'm not a foodie, but I do always make a list of things I would like to try and I make a point of trying to eat only that culture's foods with a few exceptions. But overall that is definitely not why I travel.",
      "I 100% travel for food (as does Mark Weins).  \n\nI see comments on Cuba here.  Lost count how many times I've been there, the beaches are good/decent, resort food is more miss than hit.  BUT, if you know Spanish and had hookups where you could eat at a local's house for langosta (lobster), garlic sauce, rice and beans, plantain chips, and slices of tomato and cucumber - then the food is great.  I've also had nice steak in Camaguey.  I can't say that the food is completely terrible in Cuba after visiting a local's home and having a delicious home cooked meal.",
      "Food is huge for me.  The only way I justify not exploring the food scene every day, is if I'm really shoestringing it and trying to cook for myself.  If I'm travelling for 3 weeks I'll have moments where I just want a burger, but they should be few and far between but those occasional cravings do come.\n\nI think the best part is not necessarily just the most decadent food, but discovering new ingredients and cooking.  I never would have thought I'd like cactus pads so much, but in mexico they became my favorite vegetable.  I've cooked vegetarian tacos for my vegetarian friends to introduce them to that magic since.  Otherwise are there are many fruits, veggies, and spices common to other cultures that I find really interesting.  Usually even the most authentic restaurant in your home area is quite different from actual local cuisine as well, and I love spices so I generally lean towards those styles.",
      "Reading these comments makes me feel like an uncultured savage. I mostly eat supermarket food, and my experiencing of local food is limited to \"this place has drinking yoghurt and that one doesn't\", and \"oooh, what are these candies/chocolates/cookies\". Honestly, I don't mind, I get to experience some variety this way too, and this is the limit of how much I care about food.",
      "Travel = food",
      "0%. It's cool to try new things but I lived in Thailand and the best Thai I ever had was in Washington DC. All Thai chefs but the produce and meat quality is way better in the US. NZ has shit food but it's a great place to be. Myanmar had the best food I've ever had but I wouldn't go back for that."

    "selftext": "Let me start with what people do wrong, women and men alike.\n\nI don\u2019t know why people take the cheapest train (general class tickets) to travel, especially as a woman. I\u2019m Indian, and my grandparents are Indian, and they would never take that\u2014not in their wildest dreams, VERY unsafe, no matter if you are a man or a woman, you will get robbed or something will happen, The only people who travel in those coaches is someone who can't travel ANY other way, it's the last resort for the poorest of the poor, but they know how to deal with criminals and offenders, you don\u2019t. Also why do people try to travel to these absolute slums and be like, \u201cOhhh how dirty and unsafe,\u201d like no shit, Sherlock. Like, what are you even looking for over there? Nobody has ever found anything meaningful there, not even the people who live there.\n\nIn Delhi, I see them in these industrial towns and crowded streets and I\u2019m like, are you looking for cheap rubber and 4-gauge wiring for the house or something? Like, what are you doing there? What are you trying to find in a packed bazar at 6pm?\n\nBuses\u2014Why do you always take the most suspicious-looking, cheapest, bus and travel to the most dangerous, isolated places, and then when something happens and boom\u2014\u201cIndia this, India that.\u201d\n\nThere isnt much to visit in states like:\n\nUttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Madhya Pradesh (MP), New Delhi\n\nCompared to what other places have to offer. These states do have places you can visit, but it\u2019s usually not safe, especially UP, Bihar And very polluted and crowded. Maybe save it for when you have some experience with India and know how to deal with it. Don\u2019t let it be the first stop. You most often than not will not like it cuz you won\u2019t know what the good spots are and the bad parts of them are really bad, dangerous even. Maybe take a guide but despite that, some of the other places I mention offer a LOT more than these if you are looking for a nice trip with some mind blowing monuments that is safe and peaceful. Like people visit river ganga in UP, literally the dirtiest it will ever get. Full of industrial toxic waste from up stream and lord knows what kind of diseases you will find there. If you want to see Ganga go to Uttrakhand.  The most Majestic landscapes, Beautiful weather, and the river is crystal clear! Going to see Ganga in UP is like drinking water from a public sink and saying water gets me sick. No it doesn't you just drank it from the shittiest source imaginable!\n\n\u2026and somehow these bad states I mentioned are the only places they ever want to go to! I\u2019m guessing they do this so they can get a retreat from urban life... like going to desolate places to feel like they are away from civilization! But that is not how you approach India.\n\nThis is the other side of the globe\u2014our cultures, civilization, and way of life are completely different from yours. Your rules of society and life are not how it's going to be here, so you can\u2019t travel to this place like you\u2019re going on a Florida trip over spring break or something.\n\n**So, here is a local\u2019s guide to visiting India and having fun, for women and men alike...**\n\n**Skip the popular touristy destinations**\u2014they are not good at all. The actually beautiful parts of India are never found there. These \u201cpopular\u201d spots were places the Brits often did business in, so they got popular in the West. That is NOT India.\n\n**Good rule of thumb on where to visit:**\n\n* **Rajasthan** (Safe and beautiful architecture, desert and some very colorful houses)\n* **Gujarat** (The salt lakes and food, Gir national park)\n* **South India** (Some INSANE temples \u2014 *not* Mumbai, there\u2019s not much to see there) It is also very safe and western friendly cuz every other guy you seen on the street in south India has some family member or themselves or their kids living in the US or UK. Very polite and reserved people. Quite clean. \n* **Goa** (Very Western-friendly, beautiful cathedrals and nice beaches. You will find a lot of foreigners there, so you can feel a little at home)\n* **The Islands** (Amazing beaches and scuba diving experiences)\n* **Eastern India like Darjeeling and Meghalaya** (Beautiful, and I mean just enchanting tea plantations)\n\n**How to travel...**  \nDON\u2019T take cheap trains. Travel in first-class coaches (costs like $25 to $40 to go from north India to south India). You *will* get robbed and bad things happen in the cheaper compartments. Second and first AC compartments are also pretty good, first is very good, second is pretty decent too. Middle class families go in there so most likely you\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019ll definitely be fine in first AC and first class. All trains in India that provide interstate travel are sleepers. And all of them have first and second AC compartments and most have first class too, so it\u2019s perfect for long travels! And Indian rail network is pretty awesome. You\u2019ll get to see it all. Like the California Zephyr but much faster. \nRailway stations are dirty, so try to not rest bags on the floor, they will get very noticeably soily. I\u2019m a bit fuzzy about being clean so I put mine on the bench. \n\nFirst-class train coaches have a closed door, your own bed, room service, clean toilets, air conditioning, a mattress, and bed sheets\u2014and yes, for $25. There is police officer's coach very nearby and the pople in those coaches are quite respected (Professors, important or highly educated people) so no groaping or staring there. I mean you go to these places where people dont have money to buy lights for their houses and travel in train compartments that nobdy wants to take, unless they have no other option in life, and then something happens to you there and the whole country is to take blame for that. How is it fair for us?\n\nOr take a damn plane! They are cheap, safe, and ABUNDANT.\n\nLook, if you dip your hand in a toilet, you will get shit on your hands. So don\u2019t dip your hand in the toilet by traveling in the cheapest trains and going to the most god-awful slums solo.\n\n**Getting around:**  \nTake **Uber** or **Ola** (like Uber).  \nMetro is exceptionally safe in 2025.\n\nAvoid buses if you can, you are not a local on minimum wage, you dont need to sweat and suffocate in them, and there is no new exprience to gain there. In south India, busses have separate women\u2019s compartments (at least in Telangana), and if a guy tries to get in there, he\u2019ll probably get stomped by the locals. In new delhi they upgraded the bus to AC ones and its free for women.\n\n**Food:**  \nDo NOT eat stuff that doesn\u2019t look edible or isn\u2019t in a clean place. Like, come on\u2014God gave you eyes and a sense of smell for a reason. If it doesn\u2019t look clean, don\u2019t eat it. doesn't have to get any more complicated than that.\n\nThe locals have a different immune system. You don\u2019t. Don\u2019t be a hero.\n\nIndian food is some of the best food you will ever taste, so eat it at good places\u2014some nice hotels or temples.\n\n**NOT on the streets. Again, NOT in the streets.**\n\n**Things to keep in mind:**  \nIn India, cities are not for people to relax or have fun nights out. We are mostly an industrial, working nation, so cities are crowded, very polluted, and dirty. Simply because the only function they serve is for people to come there, work, and go back.\n\nFor pleasure, nobody goes to the city\u2014they go to their hometowns or other destinations. It\u2019s not like the West or NYC. New Delhi is NOT NYC. It\u2019s more like industrial Detroit. You wouldn\u2019t travel overseas to see the Ford factory in Detroit, would you?\n\n**States to avoid at all costs:**\n\n* Uttar Pradesh (UP)\n* Bihar\n* Madhya Pradesh (MP)\n* Haryana\n\nNothing to see there, and some pretty disgusting people. Not safe at all. Nobody in India ever even once decides to go for vacation there, so you shouldn't either.\n\n**States or cities to not go to (because there\u2019s nothing good there):**\n\n* **Mumbai**\n* **New Delhi**\n\nThere is nothing very striking about them other than the fact that they are big cities. Use these as hubs to then start your main traveling. You don\u2019t need to spend too much time here. They are quite crowded and busy, Delhi is very polluted but it\u2019s convenient to start your traveling from. If you need to shop for things, know that it\u2019s 2025, there are massive supermarkets you can go to! You don\u2019t have to go to a street vendor or local shop if you don\u2019t feel like it. \n\nIf you keep these things in mind, I **guarantee** you\u2019ll 100% have a GREAT time.  \nIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll reimburse your trip\u2014no joke.\nEdit: grammar and tone ",

      "Thank you for your recommendations!\n\nAs someone who has travelled to Bihar, I was absolutely shocked by the living conditions in Patna. I've never seen anything even close to this, like scenes out of a horror movie. Bodhgaya, however, is a must see destination for Buddhist travellers, and I found it amazing and peaceful.",
      "As a local, a lot of this is just nonsense. I do agree with the \"don't be cheap\" advice.\u00a0\n\n\n> There isnt much to visit in states like:\n\nUttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Madhya Pradesh (MP), New Delhi\n\n\n\n\nThis is an insane thing to say. What about Agra, Khajurao, Ochhra, Bodh Gaya? And the Taj Mahal? There's a LOT to see but these states aren't very safe.\n\n>These \u201cpopular\u201d spots were places the Brits often did business in, so they got popular in the West. That is NOT India.\n\nEh? It's news to me that British did business in the Taj and in Jaipur and popularised them. Like, I'm sure it has nothing to do with the architecture and history. It's the British. \ud83d\ude44\n\n>In India, cities are not for people to relax or have fun nights out. We are mostly an industrial, working nation, so cities are crowded, very polluted, and dirty. Simply because the only function they serve is for people to come there, work, and go back.\n\nMy whole life has been a lie ... Thanks to you, I know I don't exist. My night out this weekend in a CITY didn't happen. I mean, there's a reason flats are expensive in cities. Because people LIVE there! There not going \"back\" anywhere.\u00a0\n\n>For pleasure, nobody goes to the city\u2014they go to their hometowns or other destinations.\u00a0\n\nThis is utter nonsense.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n>States or cities to not go to (because there\u2019s nothing good there):\nMumbai\nNew Delhi\nNothing to see there other than shops, dirty rivers, and working people.\n\n\n\n\nNever heard about Elephanta Caves, Prince of Wales Museum, Marine Drive, Sanjay Gandhi National Park etc.? Or Red Fort, Qutub Minar, Connaught Place, Humayun's Tomb,\u00a0 Lotus Temple, etc.? You've just got a random narrative in your mind and you're running with it without factoring in facts.\u00a0",
      "Someone finally said it.\n\nIndia is still a relatively poor country, but also has some decent to good options if you pay more money. The advice for transportation also applies to food \u2013 what do you expect when you eat that $1 street food meal? It's that cheap for a reason \u2013 following food safety standards costs money. You can get decent quality and safe meals for $5 per person in a city, which is still cheap if you're a North American/western European/rich east Asian tourist. Even a premium restaurant would cost only about $10-15 per head. \n\nDon't go to India all fascinated by stories of how cheap everything is \u2013 while a big reason for low costs is low wages, low quality controls, lack of professionalism, and low safety standards also play a major role. If you live in a country with average yearly incomes of $40-70k, there's no reason to take that $0.3 bus with questionable safety.\n\nBut UP and MP have a shit ton of history and culture so not sure why you think there's nothing to do there, OP.",
      "That's quite exaggerated and misleading. Canceling entire states like MP, which is full of ancient temples in Ujjain, Khajuraho, Buddhist stupas of Sanchi, million year old rock caves of Bhimbetka and the list continues. It is also the best place to do a tiger safari. Not everyone is interested in visiting scenic places. People are more into food, culture, and history when they visit India. You can find beautiful untouched landscapes outside India as well, but it is the culture, the art, the history, and the food that is unique.",
      "Holy shit this is why you shouldn't always trust the locals.\n\n>There is NOTHING to visit in states like:\n\n>Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Madhya Pradesh (MP), New Delhi\n\nLolwat???\n\nYou're aware that the Taj Mahal is in Uttar Pradesh? Agra Fort, Varanasi (I'll be the first to shit on this city but still think it's worth a day at least).\n\nBihar has Bodh Gaya, maybe the most important place in Buddhism?\n\nTo put Madhya Pradesh on this list is a fucking joke... Gwalior Fort, Raja Mahal, Khajuraho, etc. Orchha was possibly my favorite place in India... if anything, not enough people visit MP.\n\nNew Delhi is okay, not great. Mumbai on the other hand is awesome, you're delusional.\n\nThis is seriously one of the worst posts I've ever seen on India.",
      "I went to Delhi, Varanasi, and Mumbai, Ahmedabad as a solo traveler and at almost exclusively street food, and would walk around town alone, took budget train to the Taj Mahal and I was treated with nothing but respect, never got sick, never got robbed, and never looked at as an easy target. I think you are steering people away from many beauties those places have to offer.",
      "I\u2019d say this is a really negative post that over generalizes quite a bit. These places may not call to you, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re worthless. I\u2019m a musician and will always seek out the incredibly talented gurus who live in cities where you say \u201cthere\u2019s nothing good.\u201d Or the food? Amazing food in Delhi and Mumbai. I could go on and on, but would recommend taking OP\u2019s suggestion with a massive grain of salt.",
      "WHAT? Nothing to see in UP or MP??? \n\nOrcha, Khajuraho, Mandu, Agra etc etc \n\nNothing to see in Delhi?? \n\nLike I agree with you that western tourists go to the most ridiculous parts of Delhi (spot on with \u201cindustrial lighting for a wedding\u201d thing) but I disagree that UP and MP aren\u2019t worth visiting.\n\nAgree on the planes thing. \n\nAnd please don\u2019t victim blame. We do have a problem as a culture, which we have to acknowledge. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t think tourists should take first class with the closing doors. Take 2nd AC so you\u2019re not boxed in with someone. Creepy people can be rich also. \n\nAgree on the food thing, it\u2019s best to take it easy, eat at good places middle class locals eat at, and eat lots of yoghurt and take probiotics to get your gut used to the flora of this country.",
      "I get what you mean to say and I do think for less experienced or more...\"vacation\" kind of travellers, the advice is solid. However, I have solo travelled (as a woman) in different parts of India including UP (pilgrimage, religious stuff - which does have some appeal for some foreign travellers as well) and I cannot afford 1AC, fancy hotels and a lot of the other stuff you seem to assume all foreigners can afford. A lot of people who travel to India are still more or less \"hippies\" - people who aren't necessarily economically successful in their home country or have \"dropped out of the system\" completely and who prioritize and value different things in life.\n\nSo while, again, your tips are great for middle-class, wealthy, Western travellers (think \"Karen\"), here's some tips for everyone else:\n\nBusses are fine for short distances and unlike with trains, you won't have to deal with endless delays which may force you to use unsanitary washrooms (looking at you, Varanasi Cantt). You can just go to a bus stand and someone will yell the name of the city the bus is going to -hop on, pay when the bus leaves.\n\nEat at places that seem popular or since it's 2025, just google them in advance. There are ratings and reviews even for \"street food\" places and usually they are reliable. \n\nCarry money, cards and passport in a hidden bag under your clothes (works great when wearing loose Indian clothing)\n\nLearn to ignore everyone and everything. Beggars? Guides? Cows? Pretend you don't see or hear them and continue doing whatever it is you're doing. \n\nI agree with the supermarkets though, but be aware that those rarely sell fresh produce and if they do, it won't be good. If you are here for more than a month and you want some vitamins, learn enough Hindi/Tamil/x to buy fruit from roadside vendors. \n\nFor hotels - try to stick to 3 star hotels, otherwise try to find out beforehand if the hotel has hosted foreigners before, because some cheaper ones may refuse you check-in on arrival, due to their inability (or unwillingness) to comply with government regulations. Unfortunately, this part does mean you'll have to spend a bit more (and as a female traveller, also for your safety), as depending on the place, this can cost you between 1500 and 3000 rupees per night - still cheaper than a hotel in Europe, but considerably more than many budget travellers can afford. \n\nNever get into an auto without negotiating the price first. Auto drivers in Tamil Nadu are the biggest loots I've ever met. If you can't afford it - take the city bus. It's a bus. Like everywhere else. Nothing bad will happen. \n\nSo basically I agree, but OP ignores the reality that most foreign travellers to India, even Western ones, are college kids and hippie bums and that flights to India probably cost them 800-1000 USD. India can be done on a budget and still safely and comfortably, a compromise is possible.\n\nP.S.: I've lived in Varanasi before and I have bathed in Gangaji about a dozen times in 4 cities and I have never gotten sick. OP needs to chill.",
      "While I can't quite agree with all of OP's commentary, nor necessarily his tone, there are good points in this post.  I also sympathize with his frustation.  I've seen some downright offensive posts about India from people who haven't been there, actively discourage others from going there and base all of this on either edge cases, bad (and avoidable) traveller experiences or selective news.  It's a complicated country and there's a lot of bad, at least from my perspective, but there's also a lot of good.\n\nDefinitely do look at the places to visit list but take the \"avoid\" list with a grain of salt, understand the perils and customize it to your particular circumstances.  Some good advice on trains and food.  OP, in what world is Mumbai considered \"South\" India, lol?",
      "LOL,  Goa is a terrible place, if you want to go to beaches there are so many better places in world to go to.\n\nUttar Pradesh and Bihar are amazing. My best experiences in India are in these states, Sonepur Mela for example. bodh gaya and Varanasi of course aswell. \n\nDo I advise everyone to go to India, no it has many problems, but it can be an amazing experience for those that are comfortable with being uncomfortable for a few weeks.",
      "If you've never visited India before please ignore the negative parts of the OP's post, or miss out on so many great things, the Taj Mahal, the Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri and Sikandra, Orchha, Gwalior, Khajuraho and many more. You'd miss out on some of the best wildlife reserves too.\nDelhi and Mumbai are fantastic cities with lots to offer. \nIndian travellers in the lower train classes are the salt of the earth, yes you'll get a few rogues but generally not, they'll chat if they can, share their food and give you all the smiles.\n\nI'm no expert but I've been five times and going again this year. India is such an enchanting place, the people are wonderful, the sights sublime.",
      "I traveled solo in India as a woman for 4 months several years ago. I've been to over 50 countries at this point, and India is still easily in the top 3. \n\nI find your post a bit confusing because it really clashes with my experience.\n\nMy opinion on the places:\n\n- I LOVED Mumbai and would definitely go back. \n- New Delhi was worth the visit, but less interesting.\n- Uttar Pradesh is where the Taj Mahal is!!! That was a truly cool place to visit and I think if you're anywhere nearby you kinda have to go (would you go to Paris and not look at the Eiffel Tower??).\n- I definitely stan Rajasthan! Jaipur, Jaisalmer, etc. are all excellent cities in that area. Jaipur is probably one of my favourite cities in the world. Jaisalmer is a castle and you can go camping in the desert under the stars (10000% recommend)\n- Goa was awesome (especially for parties)\n- Kerala was awesome\n- I'm gonna throw Rishikesh on the list of places to visit because it's so unique and interesting (there's a defunct ashram full of cool graffiti where The Beatles wrote some of their greatest hits)\n\nOther opinions:\n\n- I ate street food constantly as was fine. My rule of thumb was anything cooked at high temperatures is probably ok, but raw stuff (like salad) I mostly avoided.\n- Agree with ubers to get around\n- For the first 2 months I didn't have a local SIM card, so I couldn't Uber. I took the rickshaws everywhere and it was totally fine - the only issue was the language barrier.\n- I never took any trains, but I took busses between all of those cities. They were the nicest busses I've ever ridden in my life and they were so comfortable. They were exactly how OP described the 1st class trains, except they were busses. It was like a hotel on wheels. With the movement from driving, I slept like a baby!\n\nMy recommendations would be:\n\n- Definitely go!!!!\n- Get a local SIM / eSIM\n- Figure out the vibe of the trip you want and then research the areas that match. India is so diverse that different regions make for completely different experiences.\n- Things rarely happen on schedule, so be prepared for long waits and/or unexpected delays\n- Remember that because there are so many people around all the time, you're never alone and there are always people to help. \n- Most people in the world are kind and will help. There were many times (especially in the 2 months without phone service) where I got lost or otherwise needed assistance and people went above and beyond to be kind.",
      "Just a small correction... There are many things to see in New Delhi. Lots of monuments. And most are connected by metro. Take that. Or uber. In UP, just go for the Taj Mahal and Fatehpur Sikri, but again as OP said keep that for when you are a seasoned Indian traveller, and only use first/second AC and Uber. \nIf you want a good experience, you got to spend. Stay in good hotels, eat at good places to be safe. \nYou can take some of the luxury trains for travelling in the more dangerous areas like UP. They'll take care of proper food, lodging and travel for you.",
      "I travelled in your beautiful country 20 years ago.\nGujarat and Rajasthan were by far my favourite places, I had some incredible experiences in both of these states, and hardly met any tourists. I even stayed for a while in a temple on Girnar hill.  \nAnd Gujarati food was the best!",
      "I hate those videos of people bashing India. As you said, they buy the cheapest train ticket, book the cheapest hotel, eat dirty food on the street and then those watching just believe that's what India is all about.\n\nI visited in 2023 and loved it. Was in Kerala, Rajasthan, Aggra and Ladahk. Had amazing food, stayed in nice places, got awesome massages. Did a trek in Ladahk. We had the best time. Nobody got sick. We only had situation arriving in Delhi with a scam hotel, but then moved on to a very nice place. That's what I tell people aand they are surprise because they have a warp image of India from watching those videos.",
      "I think Madhya Pradesh has a lot of beautiful destination and u cannot compare it to up, Bihar and New Delhi \nOp get ur facts straight \nMadhya Pradesh tourism has worked very hard on making it a beautiful experience be it the national parks or beautiful forts and temples like orcha, Khajuraho etc \nEven the cleanest city of India is in Madhya Pradesh along with 3 other cities that come in top 10 \nI recommend everyone in this sub to actually explore Madhya Pradesh as a destination with chattisgarh really underrated and not at all like north India"

To be fair, I don\u2019t often cook at hostels and in this case it was some leftover pizza. \n\nStill, I labeled it properly, put the tape over the opening of the box. I\u2019m disappointed because the slice that was taken is 5\u20ac each, and you\u2019d think that other fellow hostel goers understand the value of that money! \n\nProbably just some drunk late night thing, but still disappointing. Maybe I\u2019ve just been lucky until now. Has anyone else had this happen?

It sucks, but it's kinda unavoidable sometimes with hostel life. People are often inconsiderate.\n\nHonestly? You're probably going to have to let it go and just chalk it up to experience. Going around the hostel accusing other guests isn't going to be very productive, and besides, that pizza is long gone.",

The Big E could be interesting as it's all the states of new england in one. has all the major state fair trappings you get elsewhere but then you get variety since there's different buildings for each different state's specialty (lobster rolls in the maine building, maple syrup in the vermont building)\n\nPlus it's in the fall in new england which is gorgeous. Right by the berkshires for leaf peaping. And not too far from Boston (1.5 hr drive) or NYC (3hr drive) \n\nI'd build the trip around places nearby you want to visit and go from there since any state fair will have animals, fried food and carnie style games and rides",

Go early start with a coffee and breakfast at the farmers Union, then get some deep fried veggies, I like to hit up the dairy barn in the Empire Commons as early as possible too (their strawberry sundae is hands down the best I\u2019ve had anywhere). You could go for a flight of craft beer in the agriculture building then walk around the international bazaar. Take the gondola to the old town area and get a pickle on a stick or a bucket of sweet Martha\u2019s cookies. Then find a place for another afternoon beer in the old time outdoor shopping area or head to the dug out for a mini donut beer (another favorite). Make sure to get the cheese curds next to the giant slide and\u2026 well\u2026 you get the idea.\n\nOh and it is even more fun to checkout the \u2018new foods at the fair\u2019!!

The bigger ones are all a bit unique, but as some have said there are places where the fairs will be pretty similar fair to fair. I\u2019d say base it on what type of food you\u2019re looking for. The Texas state fair is corn dog, deep fried, funnel cakes, etc. it\u2019s all good, and the fair itself is cool, but Minnesota has some unique stuff to it that\u2019s worth it as well. Look at timings too, as I\u2019m sure you have. Texas\u2019 is late September-October, i don\u2019t remember when Minnesota\u2019s is. Just my two cents, i hope you end up enjoying wherever you go!",

      "You can do a fair in a day pretty easily if you don\u2019t need to experience absolutely everything. \n\nYou\u2019ll get a good feel for the culture and get to eat delicious foods. \n\nTry to get things that are made in front of you. Skip things like pizza trucks.\nIt\u2019s going to be oil and sugar overload so drink water and know that this is your day to go all out! \n\n-\tHand dipped corn dogs (hotdog dipped in cornbread batter and deep fried). If they don\u2019t batter it there it\u2019s not worth it. \n-\tElephant Ear/Funnel Cake - these are deep fried, crisp, yet soft, doughy deliciousness. I prefer mine simply with cinnamon sugar on top. You can get a ton of other toppings but it\u2019s usually canned blueberry or apple and kind of ruins the freshness \n-\tcotton candy or a candy apple - apple dipped in a hard candy shell\n-\tDeep fried Oreo cookies - I don\u2019t know where else you\u2019d try these. They\u2019re good to have once! \n-\tSometimes they will have fresh dairy stands with homemade ice cream. These are a must! \n\nLivestock exhibits are cool. You see giant and miniature horses and all sorts of interesting working animals (working as in they have a function vs a pet). \n\nBudget $10 to play some games and win a stupid prize. The games are rigged. Watch other people play first. That\u2019s half the fun. \n\nSkip riding any rides at places like this. Or do 1-2 that look the safest. They\u2019re all kind of sketchily put together and taken down and moved it the next place in a week. \n\nAlso- you can tell a lot about the fair by the music acts they bill. \nThe Michigan State fair is real crappy - but my mid-size hometown has a great fair they get top country music artists to play. \n\nEnjoy!",

I know they occur at different times of year (state fair in the fall and rodeo in the spring) but the rodeo is the largest in the world and they have good performers. They\u2019ve had Beyonce, Cardi B, Lizzo, a bunch of country stars if you\u2019re into country music. The rodeo is similar to a state fair in that they have carnival rides, livestock, and all kinds of food",

Maybe it is magical from my childhood,  but the food... fairs with malt vinegar,  elephant ears, anything and everything fried, and a delicious apple cider slushy to wash it all down! It was small but had everything a fair was about. It is held in early October. Typically the second week. That's my two cents.",
      "Chicago. World-class food city and so many different nationalities have great cuisine here. Also it\u2019s inexpensive compared to the coasts, has direct flights to Amsterdam, and you can rent a car and go for an hour or two outside the city and find all kinds of fairs",
      "Minnesota!! I\u2019ve lived here for four years and it\u2019s an absolute blast. I\u2019ve only missed one year (2020) for obvious reasons. \n\nThe food, the local beer & wine and free (and paid) live music are all so fun! Also Minnesota is absolutely beautiful to visit and would make for a great extended trip beyond just the state fair.",
      "Avoid Ohio state fair. The food was horrible this year (2022) flavorless, and the chicken kabob was in a tub of water. They season the meat AFTER cooking and call it bbQ chicken but they just hand u a sauce packet for the bland meat. The foods gone down hill and taste like american public school lunch or something they feed an inmate",
      "Have you been to the US before? Most of the really big fairs are held in places where there is not much to see or do. Minnesota and Iowa are far from the Netherlands. Are you really planning to travel to these places for one day (maybe 2?) of eating unhealthy food? I mean, they are probably really fun but not worth the time and cost to travel from NL.",
      "The Great NY State Fair. I am from NY, although I now live in Iowa. If you can get past the pathetic government in NY and their archaic laws, This would be a great state to live in. However,\u00a0 there is a brilliant reason to visit in August and that would be The Great NY state fair. Again, you have to deal with massive amounts of people, but the 365 acre fair is definitely something you want to experience! There is so very much to do, lots of free things to get, (especially first thing in the morning), and amazing food including the infamous Dinosaur BBQ. It is the BEST BBQ you will ever have! Also, they have some delicious wine slushies, Maple products including my favorite, the Maple cotton candy and the creamies Maple soft serve ice cream. The buildings are massive and the butter sculpture is always incredible! Definitely worth making a special trip, as I do, every year to see. Totally worth the money!!!",
      "When you think of food, think Texas. Texas has the best food over all in the nation, bar none!",
      "If you\u2019re interested in seafood specifically the best crabs and crab cakes I would visit Baltimore Maryland but I\u2019ll be honest. Not worth it for you, there\u2019s plenty of better places to experience.",
      "The Minnesota State Fair is amazing! As far as food it has a HUGE range of options. If you are looking for classic fair food (pronto pups, funnel cakes, cheese curds, mini donuts) they have that but they also have every food you can think of pretty much. They make a point of having new dishes every year and you can look up before you go what the new dishes are. They come up with some really interesting dishes. Sometimes they're great and sometimes they are a little weird tbh lol but the great dishes tend to stick around throughout the years!\n\nMy favorite foods are cheese on a stick, roasted corn, and freshly squeezed lemonade. But there are so many options I like to follow my whims while I'm there!\n\nBesides food they have tons of exhibits, rides, games, events and activities throughout. Plus all the fair animals!! One year I watched an alpaca costume contest. I like to watch the lumberjack contest every year too. And they have great beef jerky at the lumberjack area!\n\nYou really don't need too much time to visit the fair, I have gone for a couple of hours and been happy with that, it depends on how much you want to see and eat lol I will say I enjoy going in the afternoon and evening because when all the fair lights are on, it's just pretty. And you can ride in the ferris wheel or across the entire fair grounds in the sky glider. There is really no way to do everything at the fair, so you don't really need a certain amount of time, but I do like to spend at least half a day.\n\nAlso Minnesota is a beautiful state with a lot to do besides the fair! I would definitely recommend visiting.",
      "The Minnesota State Fair. I\u2019m from the Twin Cities, now live 1300 miles away, but return  \nevery August to visit friends/family and go to the Fair. I remember deep fried candy  \nbars, the roasted corn on the cob in the husk that I can smell as I type this, and  \nthere are many new foods every year. I once volunteered with a friend to work at  \na Chinese place opposite the Grandstand, so got to hear the musical act that  \nnight. Buy a pronto pup from a cart or stand in line for the wonderful deep  \nfried cheese curds. I\u2019ve been wanting to go to the Texas State Fair, so am  \ninterested in reading posts about it from others.",
      "Having been to the two biggest state fairs in the nation (Texas #1, Minnesota #2), the answer is easily Minnesota. \n\nMinnesota\u2019s state fairgrounds are very well laid out. It\u2019s got its own area with grid streets, so it is very easy to navigate, whether looking for someplace specifically or just wandering in general. I found the layout to be much more organized than Texas. Minnesota also had, in my opinion, more crazy food options. \n\nOverall, I felt more impressed by Minnesota\u2019s state fair than I did in Texas."

I have made sure I have been doing non-touristy things such as yoga, going to the gym and taking nights to watch Netflix, but the tears won't stop. Money isn't an issue at the moment so I could go home whenever but I'm worried I'll regret it if I leave but also worried I will regret staying and being so sad. I know the only person who can decide what to do is me but I can't tell if I'm just giving up when things get hard or if I am being too hard on myself trying to have the \"perfect trip\". But I guess I don't even know what I truly want right now so I guess it's between being sad in Europe or sad at home. \n\nEDIT. UPDATE.\n\nI have been at a loss for words these past few weeks. When I expressed my vulnerable emotions on the internet, I never expected this sort of response. Recently I even saw someone wrote a news article about this post too. Since comments were disabled I am editing my OG post and hoping the hundreds of people who commented and offered support see this and know I thank them and appreciate them for their advice. I wanted to start by saying that I was not mentally or physically feeling like myself when I posted this, and looking back l know that my emotions got the best of me and it\u2019s not about where I was in terms of location. I fully recognize my privilege to experience this trip and it was insensitive to complain about something that\u2019s such a first world problem especially with all the global hardships currently happening. Secondly, yes I am still travelling! I genuinely took the time to read everyone\u2019s comments and private messages I received and lots of things really helped me through that low moment. Nothing like the power of strangers on the internet coming together for someone they don\u2019t even know \u2764\ufe0f I have always dreamed of travelling solo for a long time and I would\u2019ve been very upset with myself if I gave up. Not giving up when things got hard made this experience that much more meaningful. To anyone that reads this post and feels the same way, please take all of this advice and DO NOT GIVE UP. I took a lot of peoples advice and changed the entire rest of my trip. \nFor those curious: I started by de stressing in AIRE ancient baths the next day and it was 10/10, it really calmed me down. Next I ended up making some friends in my hostel and doing lots of fun things like flamenco shows and food touring around Sevilla, it truly is a magical place and I would recommend everyone spend some time in any one of the cities in the Andalusian region. Next I went on a hike on part of the Camino trail up a mountain outside of Madrid. Never underestimate how much power nature can hold for you. Finally, I am now on a farm in the Italian countryside where I am volunteering and living for the next few weeks and I feel at home and at peace with my experience so far. Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to reach out and offer advice and support. I received hundreds of messages and I physically could not respond.\nAdditionally, since it is the internet there was some rude comments and questions and I just wanted to touch on a few for my own personal sake even though I don\u2019t need to. I have been dealing with mental health issues for years but I didn\u2019t realize until I was alone for so long how much I avoided rather than resolved. Honestly I think this trip has benefited my mental health as I haven\u2019t been able to hide away from my problems. Also I\u2019m the type of person who used to choose to let mental illness stop them from living their life and it made it worse. Truthfully, i have been in therapy and think it\u2019s a great idea for everyone to do and I know that I need more of it. Another thing is I have worked multiple jobs since I was 16, and saved up a lot of money, invested, and worked for this experience all on my own (not that I need to defend that to people, but I don\u2019t like the thought of people thinking I\u2019ve been given some golden ticket when in reality I worked really hard to be here). Lastly, I made it seem that I have a bad support system at home and have no one but that\u2019s not true and it came across poorly during my moment of weakness. I have many friends, and family members who love and support me but didn\u2019t entirely understand what I was going through in that moment so it felt like I didn\u2019t have anyone. Anyways, this trip has been the most difficult, amazing, important, eye-opening experience I\u2019ve ever had and now I don\u2019t want it to end. I am grateful for all of the ups and downs and if you find yourself so fortunate, everyone should experience a solo travel trip at least once in their lifetime. ",

      "I think perhaps you\u2019re run down, and still in recovery mode. It can take longer to fully recover when travelling. Take a day or three of rest and eating nourishing food. Make sure you\u2019re getting enough protein. Make sure you have enough electrolytes in your system. Sleep. Go to a movie. Go for a short walk. Re-evaluate after a few days. There\u2019s no shame in going home. There\u2019s no shame in changing your mind. There\u2019s no shame in needing something different than you planned. Whether that\u2019s another destination, home or a different approach to travel. You had a dream, you made it come true. Give yourself some grace to recover and only then decide. Also, join Host A Sister on FB. Their turn around time on application to membership is good. It\u2019s free. When you apply explain it\u2019s urgent. You can meet up with local women - for a walk, a coffee, a chat. It may do wonders for you. Wishing you all the best. Edit: typo and spelling error.",
      "firstly I think you are just feeling under the weather and therefore unable to enjoy where you are\nalso if you are just wandering around looking at stuff without doing a bit of reading,  it will seem boring. \n\nseville has a lot of interesting history...  there are beautiful gardens and the food in that part of Spain is glorious...\n\nmaybe have a day just lying in,  recouping your energy and then going back out there.",
      "What do you enjoy doing on trips? What do you want to be doing instead of walking around and shopping?\n\nIt sounds like you're travelling without really knowing what you want to be doing once you're somewhere. Go back to the basics, why are you travelling? What do you enjoy about it?\n\nPersonally I'm not a fan of touristy cities, but when I'm in one I have a laundry list of museums and quirky little things I want to see, and of food I want to try. Meet up was great in Portugal for finding group activities such as drinks and listening to Fado music. Might be worth taking a look. But you need to figure out what you want from travelling first.",
      "I'd go drinking in a small city square for a few days. You need to relax. You have 3 months in Europe before they kick you out why not stop with all the monuments and museums and just start relaxing. Like what you said do more yoga, maybe go on a small little guided tour of some food places I'm sure they have them. Maybe go to some lakes or relaxed quiet quaint towns and get an Airbnb for a day or two. I completely understand about the Brazilian people all running around like ants and oh great another church or another museum it's horribly boring and not really seeing a country.",
      "Get moving. Head west. You can get from Seville to the south-west coast of Portugal in less than a day.\n\nLook at the smaller Portuguese towns: Praia do Luz, Villa do Bispo, Sagres, Carrapateira, Aljezur, Odeceixe.\n\nCompletely different vibe. Quieter, more reasonably priced, low-season, great weather this time of year, wholesome food.\n\nSet up on the cliffs for a week in a nice cosy space within walking distance of trails and local bars. Take a book if that's what you're into. Expect to meet some friendly folks.\n\nBalance your inner turmoil with your outer stimuli. Take some time to consider your travel values and make sure you are fulfilling them. Think ahead to a time when you'll be looking back on parts of this trip, what you will have learned, and what future you would be proud of you for doing.\n\nThis isn't about the place or other people. It's about the expectations you have of yourself. Talk to yourself the same way you would to a friend who was feeling similar feelings. It's going to be okay, not every trip is perfect but it doesn't mean that it's the opposite of perfect either.",
      "Sorry to hear that you\u2019re going through a tough time. Here\u2019s my advice:\n\n1. Life is short and if you can somehow change your mentality of being present in where you are and telling yourself how lucky you are to have this experience. Ex. the fact that you are on a 5-week epic fuckin trip in Europe. This is from someone who missed out on enjoying epic shit to the fullest in my 20\u2019s because of being sad or finding excuses to not be happy or worry.\n\n2. Be true in asking yourself, what you really want out of this trip. If it\u2019s to buy time and go be somewhere far from home to worry about life back at home and thinking it will all be solved during my trip, you will not benefit at all. You take your problems wherever you go(not absolutely everyone but usually the case) \n\n3. Look at all that you have rather than all that you may not. I have money. I have time and the ability to explore a new place in the world. I can do routine stuff like Netflix and yoga anywhere but what can I do that I can\u2019t do back home. What am I interested in doing/seeing?\n\n4. Use this time to reflect. Rather than saying you have nothing to go back to. From your approach and overall thoughts I can say that the Negative Self-Talk is very present. Life isn\u2019t supposed to be easy. If it gets hard it comes down to you and only you. With more harder experiences, you will be able to more resilience. If the same regular thoughts continue at this rate, nothing will change. Maybe think of ways on how you can improve your life back home in a positive calming way as opposed to the anxiety and loathing feelings that you are experiencing.\n\n\nSo.. you\u2019re in your mid-20\u2019s and have another month in Europe. I have faith that you can turn it around. But you need to believe it. Live it up. Meet new people, eat new foods, embrace the unknown that is traveling on your own. Remember that you can wake up and do whatever the hell you want when you\u2019re on a solo adventure. But don\u2019t let this time go by feeling the way you\u2019re feeling. Take the small steps and you\u2019ll get there\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb\n\nReach out to me if want to talk more.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSomeone who once had the same exact thoughts and feelings while being abroad on my own",
      "I am gonna try to heal you:\n\nInstead of the gym, just go on walks, you're recovering from the flu!\n\nFind the college districts in the cities you're in and you'll find stuff catered closer to your age and less homogenized, and usually art galleries, cultural hubs, music venues, etc.\n\nFind a small suburb you can commute out to via local rail for a walk around. If they all look like they are boring on google maps, just take the rail as far out and back as you can for a day of non-city quiet.\n\nGo on a vacation from your vacation: Let yourself cry it out for a night. Spend a day at as fancy a hotel as your budget allows as people have been saying and don't go out at all that day, just relax. Pick an American (if that's where you are from) styled one with a couch. Grab some comfort food either delivered or room service. Just \\*recover\\*. I just had to do this so many times on a southwest trip where I was getting national park fatigue and it helped so much. Keep your entertainment this night boring or neutral (think antiques roadshow type stuff) to relax you.\n\nCheck out whether Seville has English speaking meetups and go hang out with people around your age, see if friends happen!  \nETA: This looks fun: [https://www.meetup.com/make-friends-sevilla/events/305798750/?eventOrigin=group\\_upcoming\\_events](https://www.meetup.com/make-friends-sevilla/events/305798750/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events)\n\nThere's no perfect trips ever, in my experience, but what \\*is\\* my experience is that all the blisters and crying and panic fades over the years and you're left with the good memories. Take a breather and go make some new ones!",
      "Allow yourself to be sad :) Do your whole trip sad if you have to! \n\nDo not leave!! You will regret leaving. You know what\u2019s at home and that option is always there. Just enjoy some food and watch some good movies :) \n\nI really enjoyed doing food tours in the cities, maybe you could do a food tour each day!",
      "There is so much great advice on here.  It would be great if you could get some healthy food in you and some vitamin C, and D.  You are probably physically depleted from being sick in addition to the malaise you feel emotionally.  \n\nI also wanted to suggest [EatWith.com](https://www.eatwith.com/search?q=Seville%2C+Andalucia%2C+Spain), they have food experiences and we had some lovely ones in Spain. You can choose a food tasting, cooking class, or a meal in someone's home with other travellers.  Sometimes interacting with people helps flip the switch. I know it sounds like a lot, and you may still feel like crying, but maybe it will help a little\n\nOr maybe you want to jump on a little piece of the Camino to help you steer your focus in another direction. You can use a luggage service and there are lots of groups here or on FB that can help guide you. You will surely meet some people.\n\nGood luck, sometimes it is at times like these when we get the best surprises and opportunities. I hope you feel better soon.",
      "What do you like to do when you\u2019re home? What makes you think \u201cwow I love life, life is beautiful\u201d. \n\nFor me, one of the best moments where I was just like I love my life is when I was staying on this island near where I live and I got a great cup of coffee in the morning, had a great workout, went home and showered and putted around at the cabin and ate a nice sandwich, put on a cute outfit and went down to the rocks by the water and read my book wrapped in a big sweater and drank a giant gin and tonic watching the sunset. \n\nIf I were in your position I would figure out how to make myself feel that way. Where can I go to do a couple things: \n\n1. Be around people in a way that feels positive (coffee shop) \n\n2. Move my body or do something that feels nourishing (healthy food or a good workout) \n\n3. See something beautiful (sunset over water, fog rolling through mountains, a pretty landscape)\n\n4. Do something indulgent (giant gin and tonic)",
      "Use the Viator app or Get your guide app to find some affordable day trips/excursions or activities that will expose you to something other than the city centers. \n\nI have been living in Europe for two years and I've traveled a bit mostly solo. I often say, if you have seen one European city, you've seen them all, unless you are truly into history and van understand the differences and the impact or significance of the various buildings and sites.\n\nI do not know the dofferences, I travel for food and cultural immersion, so I tend to do wine tours, Walking Food tours, I'll check out a pub crawl, or a themed walk based on your interests. I also like hiking or water activities, tjosepull you out of the city center and puts you in contact with other travelers. I've made a few buddies from traveling solo.\n\nAdmittedly, I am a bit older, so I take pleasure in things that may not interest you, like curling up in a reading nook of a bookstore with a pot of tea. \n\nBut, honestly, crying is ok. Don't be too hard on yourself. Take a day to relax, get a massage, or hit the spa like others have suggested. You have a bit of time left here, so after you've rested and pampered yourself some, I am sure you will have a phenomenal trip.",
      "I've been sick during long trips. Actually, on every mong trip I get sick at least once. Yes. While sick we may feel like crap and would want to go back home.\n\nI was 5 days in bed in Seoul. I only got to visit the city for two days. In Venice I was 5 days bed ridden and one just recovering at the hostel had only one day to see Venice.\n\nThose downs happened \"coincidentally\" after partying for 3 days in Siem reap before Seoul and in Florence before Venice. Now I know I need to alternate my party days and not overexcert.\n\nIf you've had a tight schedule, maybe it's time to rethink it. It's not the same traveling over the weekend or a week vacation, than seven weeks. With seven weeks, you need at least one day a week to rest, relax and recover. Yes, there will be things that you'll miss, but you'll enjoy more the ones you actually see.\n\nFor example, I've been traveling for 14 months now, we were driving the Carretera austral and got to a beautiful small town (Tortel) with nice hikes. I was spent so, instead of hikes, I didn't leave the cabin for 2 days. The third was to buy some food and I only did some light hiking on my way out. Yes, I missed some sightings and hikes but I recovered.\n\nSo, include rest in your plans, sleep and eat well and take care.\n\nAll the best!",
      "Go to Italy fantastic food, warm people, and I think much better vibe than Spain , although Seville is beautiful.",
      "girl, take a day to spend in bed, hop on a video call with friends from home, order food. watch nostalgic/ lighthearted movies/tv shows. you\u2019re stressing yourself out thinking you need to make the most of your trip. take it one day at a time. the sights, the people, the experiences will still be waiting on you. take a day of rest. cry, and cry some more. get it out, it will make you feel better.",
      "My first solo trip abroad was through the Tuscany area of Italy. My social anxiety was through the roof and I had a couple of panic attacks, I could barely speak the Italian I practiced and knew. Which limited my food options, I mainly went to the grocery store or got pizza. My sleep was so messed up, even after returning. That being said, I chose the cities I visited based on points of reference interest and the general vibe. I stayed at an Airbnb outside of Bologna in a rural area. There was one train to and from, I made sure to get home just after dark because it got really foggy and it make me feel like I\u2019m was in a scary movie.",
      "You need a break. Maybe book a few days in an apartment in a smaller town to ground a little with no pressure of going out and making it a big deal. Cook your own food, go on a hike, talk to friends. It's absolutely natural to have ups and downs and sometimes all but need is to switch it up. In a couple days you'll probably be ready to go again. \n\n Only seeing the big cities can definitely get old - to find a more authentic feeling local area for a bit maybe? I have literally taken off entire weeks when I'm traveling just because I need the down time. Usually a day is fine but it isn't always.",
      "I agree with everyone else. I think you need to rest more. Order take out, stream some movies, do whatever comforts you normally. Sleep in and eat good food. \nI've only visited a few places in Europe, but I've found some places feel more like home than others. For me, Amsterdam felt really homey. Before you quit travelling, have a rest and then try at least one more city or place. \nBut if you really aren't up for it right now, don't beat yourself up. If it's something you truly want to do you'll eventually go back.",
      "This happened to me during my time in France last year. It was only 10 days, but I fell violently ill and got really depressed that I had ruined the trip for everyone. I absolutely did NOT and it was just the combined stress of being across the world with people I didn't know well (study abroad trip) and bad food. It happens to the best of us.",
      "Travel fatigue is real! Could you sign up for a couple of tours to see things from a different perspective? Walking tour? Food tour? bike tour? And to meet some folks. . .",
      "Maybe join a food tour to chat some folks up?  i did one in Seville and loved it. Also went up to the roof of the cathedral and really enjoyed the view. Hang in there. Take your time while you have it. I also rented a car and drive to Grenada.  Loved it there.",
      "Solo travel can sometimes amplify what's going on at home. Sounds like you need to connect with people. Sign up for a walking food tour. They are very social and can be a great way to break up a solo trip.\u00a0\n\n\nLots of other great tips here too.\n\n\nAlso know that this this feeling will pass x",
      "Maybe you need more human connection and purpose even on vacation, you could find somewhere to volunteer for the day, handing out food of whatever, make sure it's safe, or perhaps stay in a hostel for a night or two to hang out with other weary and lonely traveller's, or maybe there will be energetic and lively people to help lift you up.\nYou sound quite fortunate to not have money woes for months on end, but sometimes comfort can be boring or numbing and maybe you're being called to do something you haven't found yet.",
      "I spent 7 yrs on the road traveling full time. It\u2019s exhausting and if you\u2019re new to it, it can be over stimulating. I found myself feeling burnt out too.\n\n1) book a nice hotel for two nights and so a Netflix and chill with room service sort of day. Or book an airbnb and do the same but cook some of your fave comfort foods. Take a bath. Do a deep self care routine. There\u2019s a nice spa in Seville for a facial and mani. \n\n2) the other thing you might be experiencing is scenery fatigue. Much of the same. The solution to this is to change it up. Can you head to Mallorca or the Algarve? Believe you can catch a bus from Seville to Albufeira. I swear there is nothing better than walking along the ocean and listening to the waves crash to help regulate your emotions.",
      "I\u2019m sorry but you made me laugh, I don\u2019t like traveling to Europe in general, I have been like to 10 different countries, and it\u2019s all the same to me: visit old building, the church, the plaza, have crappy service, repeat! \n\nMaybe try something\u2019s you would do at home, go to the movies, eat some comfort food - once I stayed there for 6 weeks and found some hot springs, a community pool etc\u2026 it helped out!"

Because it\u2019s actually a category of food and not food itself, it\u2019s hard to describe because tapas consists of so many varieties of finger foods depending on which region of Spain you\u2019re in.

I am moving over there in a few days and have a 14 day quarantine in a hotel room when I arrive. I am going straight from the plane to the hotel, so I cannot shop myself.

For me that would be veggie chili, some different soups esp. lentil.\n\nYou could probably get instant pasta packs (western style) where you just add hot water and let it sit covered. So those don\u2019t need refrigeration. You can get the pouch packed tuna if you like tuna.\n\nInstant/quick cook Ramen. With all the stuff to jazz it up. They probably have all kinds of refrigerated and shelf stable ramen topping stuff.\n\nFor the ramen, or anything else, you can get fresh veggies and greens that will last the first week. I\u2019d get carrots and greens.\nFor the second week you could have pickled greens and radish and stuff as garnish.\n\nHave them check for some microwaveable rice packs and maybe Japanese style curry. I\u2019m guessing they might have shelf stable versions of that as well.\n\nPart of my reasoning for looking for shelf-stable stuff is that a mini fridge isn\u2019t going to hold two weeks of food on it\u2019s own.",

No? From what I understand, if it's a hotel quarantine, food is provided. Hmmm. \n\nGet some beer and sake too, you know, why not. Lol.",

You can\u2019t possibly fit enough fresh food for that long into a mini fridge. Ask your spouse, or if there is a relocation agent or support person, or even some other wife in the same unit that you can ask. Somebody knows and can tell you what you need to put on that shopping list. What store are they shopping at? As in, is it on base or off base? Because what is available and realistic will be really different.",

Some countries allow delivery / packages to be sent to individuals in the hotel quarantine. \n\nAlso its strange that you need to bring your own food, saw various friends posting their quarantine experience in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore they were provided with hot meals (3 main + tea snack) by the hotel as part of the package.",

Honey for oatmeal, table salt, instant noodles, hard candies, assortment of nuts, powdered plant fibers for digestion. You will be limited in mobility for two weeks so get a resistance bend for exercises. Once in Japan make sure you have an electric teapot, boiling water in microwave is impractical to say the least. Get a real tea not a teabags, practicality and taste. Also I would have a groats, check import rules of Japan. Look for 3-4 small meals a day. Take a spoon just in case. Take a food thermometer if you are going to cook in a microwave. Also a small first aid kit, and if you have allergies you already know what you will need, if you don\u2019t consult a physician on what meds you can buy in case you don\u2019t know that you have an allergic reaction to something that you have not encountered before , since you are moving in a new country.",

I loved seeing all of the spices in the Israeli markets, all of the potatoes and tropical Amazonian fruits in Lima, and beautiful cuts of meat in Midwest US butcher shops. \n\nEdit: I also find that a lot of foods in countries outside the US taste better or different because of our food culture and safety laws.

Once there, I base my activities around \u201cculture,\u201d which mostly means eating delicious things, learning things, looking at art and architecture, and people-watching. I always check out the grocery stores to see what\u2019s interesting and try out the local yogurt/cheese/snacks, and I love everything from street food to fancy schmancy restaurants.

Great Italian food, though, and some of the best Mexican I've had outside of Mexico!\n\nSome of the street food is amazing, although it gets repetitive pretty quickly. Best pineapple I've ever eaten, and I've lived in Queensland!  Pork on a stick is great, mango sticky rice is fabulous.  Anything from a street vendor is going to be good. Tiny pancakes!

I don't know where you're going in cambodia, but siem reap is like barely cambodia, unfortunately.  Hard rock cafe and \"mexican food\".  You gotta dig deep, and hopefully visit some other areas.  I'm in Thailand right now.  It's hot as shit and low season, so a lot of restaurants aren't busy anyway, plenty of tables.  Malaysia and Singapore are spectacular as well when you have a chance, and super silly cheap.  It seriously bums me out to see kids in the hostels living off pbj and instant noodles.     ",

      "When I taught in Korea and was very nervous about going out by myself still, I started going to the same little restaurant and methodically ordering everything on the menu day by day. That was so much fun. Food is the most important part of travel! I remember I went with a group to Japan for a year and everyone else lost weight while I managed to gain 10 pounds.\n\n\nI travel in the US now almost exclusively, but I'm still having a good time finding regional foods, old and new. I hope to try lionfish soon. (Why is that so hard to find on menus???)",
      "Yes you need to do a foodie tour. For example http://saigononbikes.com/ in Ho Chi Minh City is great. Other cities in neighbouring countries will have equivalents. ",
      "Honestly no not at all. I'm in the middle of a 4 month trip visiting London/All across the USA/China and Hong Kong. The only local food I've tried is the deep dish pizza in Chicago and it wasn't all that great.\n\nI've been to McDonald's more times than I can count.. can't pass up those $3 meals. More money to use on great experiences and activities.",
      "I\u2019ve been to Thailand (too young to remember much, except this roti prata or Indian crepe or pancake thing with condensed milk and banana and it was the most amazing thing 10 year old me has tried) and also Luang Prabang and Vientiane in Laos!\n\nOne of the most memorable moment was (I was traveling in a group of 20-odd as we were going to some village for a community project) when we chose this street vendor by the river Mekong. We got seated into some mat by the road with short and long tables set up, and we had our meal by the river, on the roadside. It was a most delectable dinner! I remember having this \u201ccoconut\u201d ball filled with rice - heavenly! I think it was rice battered with coconut and fried?? The seafood and chicken were also bomb!",
      "I just got back from a trip that was 90% food focused.  Went mainly to Japan, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Thailand, and had 24 hour layovers in Singapore and Taiwan.\n\nIf you're going for the food definitely try to do a lot of research ahead of time - I found that lots of food places in the touristy areas will dumb down their flavours for tourists (less spice, not using fermented fish, etc.).\n\nOther than the layovers I did a cooking class and a food tour in each - no matter how much research I did the food tours always had some really interesting places / foods that I wouldn't have thought to have gone to or tried, and it's a great way to break up the solo bit for a night too and try a lot of different things that you might not have gotten solo like a whole fish.\n\nDefinitely also look for the local wet markets and go in the early morning when they're the most alive - lots of places to eat around most of them and you can really check out the ingredients and get more into the culture as food is such a huge part of it.\n\nIn Cambodia would definitely recommend Siem Reap food tours if you'll be there, and Cuisine Wat Damnak - got a 6 course meal at a place that had made Asia's top 50 for $30 usd.\n\nAlso saw that you're looking at Gaggan - I loved it, but I'm a cook that's interested in molecular and got a seat at their R&D lab where you see them put everything together and it's less formal.  95% of the courses you eat with your hands and they're 1-2 bites, so don't go in expecting a typical Michelin starred course menu - I think that's part of why it's so polarizing to people - expectations.",

So why is it easy?\n\n\\- Mobile/5G: you can get a SIM card at the airport for very cheap (I can't remember but less than 10 USD with 1.5 GB/daily (I then upgraded to 2.5 GB daily)) with your passport. 5G pretty much everywhere. Communications solved.\n\n\\- Transportation: Uber is king (except Goa). Cheap and efficient domestic flights everywhere. I bought all my domestic flights, bus and train tickets online before my trip. So very easy, as if I was in the US or Europe. I only took a tuk-tuk in Agra. So no arguments or discussions. Delhi even has a great metro system (and even tourist card for 3 days for like 6 USD).\n\n\\- Language. Pretty much everybody speaks English. Or you will find someone who speak English in 1 minute.\n\n\\- Safety. Overall I found India extremely safe (as a man). You can walk any time any where with valuables. My main concern were the stray dogs. I found most people just minded their business and didn't try to cheat me.\n\n\\- Food. That is the thing that worried me the most. I avoided eating in \"popular\" places; just went to more upscale Indian places if I wanted something local. Otherwise there is McD/BK/KFC/Starbucks everywhere.\n\nSo how is India that difficult? Yes, there is poverty and some places are very dirty but the place is at this point extremely globalised and Westernised.\n\nI can imagine there are dozens of countries which are way harder.\n\n&#x200B;",

      "I finally visited solo after being invited to a wedding.

      "well yes, if you have the money it's fine. in fact, you can hire a driver to take you everywhere you want to go in an ac car if you have enough money and you never encounter anything but traffic.\n\nbut if you want to backpack around India and try street food and take regional trains and not shell out $50-$100 per flight and take air conditioned ubers everywhere? india is much harder.\n\nand then yes, add in being a woman (especially a foreign woman) and it's even worse.\n\ni say this as someone of indian descent who has lived and worked in india and blends in pretty well when she wants to. india can be fucking exhausting if you don't want/have money to throw at every inconvenience.",
      "I agree mostly with your comment. I didn\u2019t really find most of those things difficult in India. And I went in the days before Uber and took a lot of tuktuks. What I found difficult was the sheer amount of people, the pollution, and the level of poverty. Then, coming from the US, my jet lag was awful. So add a lot of people, the level of poverty, and jet lag\u2026taking the train from Delhi to Agra was actually a little peaceful (we weren\u2019t in the fanciest class, but the level below). We sat with a family who shared their food and newspaper and had a lovely time. Then we found a vendor selling glass bottle Coke outside Agra fort and I made his day by buying 4 bottles and giving him a great tip because it seemed like everywhere served Pepsi and I am a Coca-Cola girl. I would have bought all of his inventory and the cooler if I could figure out a way to transport it easily. I chugged 2 bottles and that was the best day ever! I didn\u2019t mind all the selfies we (two white women) took with random people all day. Who cares! I had the sweet, sweet nectar of the gods flowing through my veins for the first time in days. I find it kind of funny that strangers have pictures with me and my friend in them. \nRegarding the pollution. I have mild exercise-induced asthma. Well, I hacked and coughed most of the time in northern India. I think all of those things combined made India difficult. Knowing what I do now, I would hope a second trip there would be easier. But jet lag is always a variable that is hard to control, so who knows. I will say crying uncontrollably did make some people back off a bit.",
      "I agree. Sure OP has taken the easy option most places with non proper local food and Ubers everywhere but it\u2019s not as if the cheap local experience is difficult either. I say this as a man so this is obviously my experience\n\nTuktuks are crazy cheap to the point that even if you\u2019re being charged double it\u2019s still cheap. Uber also had a tuktuk option that you can gauge how much a tuktuk should cost roughly\n\nTaking regional trains is easy too. Even the lowest class sleeper trains are fine and comfortable - take an AC one if you want it\u2019s worth the price but the sleeper is absolutely fine\n\nBut ultimately you can\u2019t disagree with their points about 5G and English making india a much easier place to travel than basically anywhere with a serious language barrier imo. (As an English speaker)\n\nThe common backpacking route in central and South America is much more difficult to travel especially if you\u2019re comparing an attempt at a local experience to one another. Chicken buses are miles more confusing than the Indian rail system and that\u2019s without taking into consideration the language barrier",
      "As a young European woman I've traveled in India both solo and with a partner many times, now I've settled down here. It's mostly safe, but obviously you have to be careful and don't be stupid. \n\nEverywhere except for Goa you should follow the dress code to limit the attention from men, they may stare anyway if you are white, but not too much if you dress up like an Indian. \nIt's nice to be friendly with the locals, but sometimes being too friendly may send them a wrong message, so it's important for a woman to find a balance in that, after gaining experience I somehow learned to feel who I can trust and be open to and who I shouldn't smile or even look at because they might bring problems.\n\nIf you are a woman, never travel with a general class train. 3ac is fine and safe, I found 2ac class the best, very comfortable.\n\nAs for food, I've eaten in all kinds of places, various street food, local eateries, luxury restaurants, and the only time I've had a food poisoning was after eating prawns from a touristic beach restaurant in Goa.\n\nObviously everything depends on the exact places you go to. I traveled to Rishikesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Mumbai, Gokarna, Tamil Nadu, never encountered any safety problems, just some little scammers here and there, but 98% of the people I encountered were very nice and helpful. \nI've lived in Kerala for 5 months and only once somebody tried to touch me when I hitchhiked a bike, otherwise was absolutely safe, just dress up properly and don't wander the streets at nights alone. I've spent over 4 years total in Goa, and this is a safe place for everyone, male, female, LGBT, any race, even almost any age, lots of white families live here with kids in complete safety.

Indian Coffee House is a good alternative if you do prefer restaurant chains.\n\nThe most valuable experience to me when travelling is to not repeat comfort-habits and to embrace experiences which I can't have anywhere else in the world. India was so enjoyable because it has so much culture of its own. I don't want to shield myself from it, there wouldn't be much of a point in going for me then. But if people do need more comfort that's fine too - just don't miss good things because somebody told you it's scary otherwise\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: typo"

Commuting in the Netherlands is more expensive than in Belgium, however, they also have better infrastructure than we do.\n\nMake sure to check out lunch deals in every country, that way you can enjoy some local food for a lower price. For breakfast and dinner I'd opt for things that you can buy in supermarkets unless you have the budget to visit restaurants within the \u20ac15-\u20ac25 price range.\n\nAlways check whether public transport stations offer full day tickets that way you can commute as much as you want within a certain period.

      "SF is safe even for solo females. Maybe don't walk thru the Tenderloin or the Mission at 2am alone, but that's just common sense.\n\nMy absolute favorite thing to do there having lived there for years and still live in the Bay is to just walk, walk the streets. Along the Embarcadero, Nob Hill, Marina/Crissy Field, it's a visually stunning city.\n\nAreas that can suck are parts of the Soma and Mission where it gets real tent cityish, or the tenderloin where it just can be grim.\n\nIt's hard to get a bad meal there, from hole in the wall to fine dining. I would not stand in line for anything unless you're dead set on going. Don't stand for Swan's Oyster Depot for example. Not because it's not worth it but because there's so many great places, food is so serious there, you will find hidden gems.\n\nAvoid Fisherman's Wharf, or at least spend little time there. DO ride a cable car, it's worth it.\n\nWear layers, one minute it will bright full sun tank top moment and then you walk a block and it's a gusty cold street and need a layer.  Wear sneakers or good walking shoes. Don't worry too much about being dressy it's not a dressy place.\n\nI can recommend so many places but honestly, just walk about. For a museum DeYoung in golden gate is so worth it because it's in the park. OR Legion of Honor because it's gorgeous and after you can do cliff walks behind it.",

All the places you recommended are super nice and I'd recommend the western parts of SF (which is where Golden Gate Bridge is, as well as Golden Gate Park and Sutro Baths/Land's End).\n\nThe Downtown area i.e. South of Market and Tenderloin should be avoided since there's a ton of homeless and drug addicts there. If you are renting a car, definitely be wary and take ALL your stuff with you. Car break-ins are rampant and the biggest thing I'd be concerned about.\n\nFor food, Little Italy is good for pasta. Chinatown has some solid places but also check out San Tung and Empero Taste in west SF. For art and museums, de Young in Golden Gate Park is great, as well as the California Academy of Sciences. MoMa was okay from what I recall, nothing crazy.",

      "I think SF tourist zone areas like Fishermans Whurf and Union Square are really fun. We visited FW multiple times and it was great each time.  Loved the weird arcade game warehouse.\n\nBut the downtown area things can change drastically even a block or two away from a tourist zone. Fortunately as you get further out of downtown the city is mostly very safe.\n\nThe Outer Sunset neighborhood south of Golden Gate Park isn't the official Chinatown but it has a ton of Chinese eateries. I'd say most of these are on the more authentic side. So if something says Sichuan, expect spicy. Hot pot, family style dining with round tables, etc....\n\nIn the actual Chinatown, the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory is well worth the visit.\n\nAlkatraz tour is a must do.\n\nGolden Gate Bridge you do not have to go to, and you can get great views of it throughout the city.\n\nIf you see a set of stairs, start to climb it. Guaranteed to get an amazing view.\n\nNorth Beach has amazing Italian food. Make sure to read the reviews on Google/Yelp and pick what sounds good to you.\n\nI will say dining out in SF can be really pricey. I was in Los Angeles the week before and I'd say its easily twice as expensive as LA, maybe even a bit more. I also don't really feel like there's as much of a cheap streetfood culture as LA has.",
      "Go to the Swan Oyster Depot on Polk. It's a SF seafood institution. It's tiny, you'll have to wait in line but it's totally worth it. Perfect for solo traveler. Lucca Deli on Chestnut has amazing sandwiches that I like to take and eat at Crissy Field.",
      "Just did a 3-day trip in SF earlier this month as a solo female traveller and here are my tips:\n\n- Hayes Street between Franklin and Laguna has good higher-end brand shops (but not designer) and tasty food. I got ice cream from Salt and Straw and it was delicious. Would also recommend Arbor for lunch or dinner. I walked up Hayes Street up to the Painted Ladies so it was easy to do. The \"Four Seasons Houses\" are more beautiful alternative to the Painted Ladies so I would recommend going to see those as well.\n\n- Free Downtown [SF walking tour](https://www.guruwalk.com/walks/30720-sf-free-tour-the-incredible-stories-of-san-francisco) through Guru Walks was excellent. It was 2.5 hours and was a very efficient way to learn a lot about SF in a short period of time. They take you through Chinatown and to the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory which is cute and if you buy anything you get a reusable bag which isn't great quality, but a fun souvenir. They will also give you a fresh, unshaped fortune cookies as a snack.\n\n- The cable car is touristy but it is a MUST-DO. Wait at the Fisherman's Wharf terminus and not Powell Street. I waited 1 hr to get on and the Fisherman's Wharf stop has a nice breeze and views of the Golden Gate Bridge while waiting. There was also a busker playing music which added to the vibe. Powell Street is at the base of the hill along a busy street and overall less relaxing. Hang off the edge of the street car, high-five passengers on passing street cars and laugh with your conductor. You can pay on board with your Clipper card or cash - the conductor will have a machine as well as cash.\n\n- Golden Gate Bridge during golden hour is amazing. It takes 1 hr of walking to get to the lookout point (30 min across the bridge and 30 min to hike up for me). I didn't stay too long as I wanted to avoid hiking down in the dark and walking the bridge at night when I knew the winds would be stronger.\n\n- Take a walk through the Castro neighbourhood. This is a historic LGBTQIA neighbourhood and it is really lovely to witness such a supportive community. You can easily walk to Dolores Park and the Mission neighbourhoods after. Go to Tartine Bakery and get a morning bun (cinnamon-pastry with citrus - delicious!)\n\n- Alcatraz was better than expected. It is very windy though so make sure to dress appropriately. The State Park Rangers are 10/10 for enthusiasm and they have talks going on throughout the day. \n\n- I didn't have time to go but many people recommended Golden Gate Park. It's bigger than Central Park and there are lots of things to do. I was warned that certain things like the botanical gardens and the Japanese tea garden cost admission so keep that in mind.\n\n- Be prepared for the weather - the bay breeze makes it feel a lot cooler than it shows on the Weather app. Bring extra layers just in case - a pashmina is not going to help with the wind (learn from my mistake...)\n\n- Like you, I was warned that SF was sketchy but honestly I felt really safe. I walked in the \"South of Market\" neighbourhood along Mission Street and would not recommend it but it was 8am and people kept to themselves so not an issue. A lot of places were fine and I didn't have issues on public transit. I found locals to be friendly and helpful. I didn't have issues coming back at night either. \n\nHave the best time on your trip! I really loved SF and would 100% return.",
      "SF is basically the home of Chinese-American food, so going for Chinese, or indeed most asian cuisines, is a great idea. You can have known Chinese-American dishes or stretch and try to order something off the part of the menu that is only in Chinese. Don't ask for rice if you order a noodle dish.\n\nYou don't say if you're flying or driving, but if you drive then always park in secured parking, and if you decide to park on the street, do not leave anything in the car for any period of time.\n\nIf you want some local culture, there is a really good nerd bar called The Interval down near the water. It is much cooler than that sounds, but it is unquestionably a place that could only exist in SF.\n\nYelp and Google Maps are from the SF area, so in general restaurant ratings there are accurate simply by the law of large numbers. It's not uncommon to see a place with three thousand reviews that is just a local spot. Don't go anywhere under 4 stars.\n\nThere's an art museum in Golden Gate Park that might be up your alley. It's fairly close to Haight. You can walk around the park in the day without too much concern. There should be bison somewhere.\n\nIn good weather consider taking the ferry to Sausalito to see the bay, Alcatraz, and golden gate from the water with a drink or snack from the bar, ubering to the bridge, walking across, and ubering back to wherever. There are also autonomous cars that I have mixed feelings about but are often spoken of very highly.",
      "Chinatown has plenty of open spaces. Take the underground Muni T line to the new Rose Park station. It takes you right to Stockton st which is the top (West) part of Chinatown. Practically nothing boarded up on it or side streets. Also walk along Grant st.  Plenty of good  Chinese food. \n\nHaight Ashbury is not a posh shopping district. It has some homeless and gutter punks walking/ sitting on the sidewalk, but it's safe. They won't hassle you  For me the interesting part is from where Haight ends at Golden gate Park to Haight and Ashbury itself. Fun shops. Plenty safe especially during the day.",
      "Welcome in advance to San Francisco! There are so many great recommendations in this thread already, so I'll focus on suggested Muni routes. There has been mention of San Tung (Chinese-Korean food), Arsicault (pastries), and Golden Gate Park. If you are exploring the Ferry Building or any other part in the northeast corner of the city (including downtown, North Beach, and Chinatown), you can take the #1 or #38R west to the Richmond District (refers broadly to the area above Golden Gate Park from Arguello all the way west to Ocean Beach. The Inner Richmond neighborhood is a fun stretch to walk around in and taste\u2014particularly Clement St between Arguello and 10th Ave. Arsicault does have delicious croissants, and there's almost always a line, but it moves quickly. If you happen to head to the neighborhood later in the day, you can enjoy wine next door at Breck's and fresh pasta at the Pasta Supply Co. Browse the books at Green Apple Books. Also in that general neighborhood is Cinderella Bakery, a Russian bakery with tasty bread, soups, Russian dumplings, and other lunch options. You can take the #44 (from, say, 6th Ave and Clement) through Golden Gate Park to the Inner Sunset neighborhood (mirrors the Richmond, but \\*below\\* Golden Gate Park), and there you'll find San Tung and many, many other eateries and shops. Arizmendi is a great co-op bakery there. If you stop in the park, know that you're in the part of the park closest to the De Young Museum. the California Academy of Sciences, and the Conservatory of Flowers. Good places to explore and burn off calories. You can head west from the Inner Sunset on the N-Judah all the way to Ocean Beach. Pay attention to the stops in the 40s Avenues (41st Ave, 42nd Ave, etc.), as you're going along Judah. There is a cute neighborhood there with a good handful of local shops and eateries. They are along Judah and Irving. I love Palm City for its sandwiches, Black Bird Bookstore for its very curated selection of books, and Hook for fish & chips. There's also the Last Straw for fun jewelry. Walk along Ocean Beach and perhaps stop at the Andytown Coffee shop location that's on the apt named Great Highway for one of their Snowy Plovers. Google Maps has great integration with Muni, so I just use it to figure out when the next Muni bus I need to get on is coming. I recommend downloading the Munimobile app because you can purchase a day pass for the same price as two Muni rides. If you want to ride a cable car, that's a separate category on the app. If you think you'll also be taking the BART, you'll want to get a Clipper Card, which is a regional transit card that you use on services besides Muni like BART and CalTrain. The bonus perk of using the Munimobile day passes is that you don't have to fumble with trying to scan your phone on the bus readers. You can just kind of wave the QR code at the bus driver, and then you're set. Muni transfers within 1.5 hours are free. That was a lot. I hope you enjoy! And make sure to check hours of businesses. Since the pandemic, a fair number of businesses don't open on Mon\u2013Wed or just have more limited hours generally.",
      "Valencia Street:  \nI recommend KitTea Cat Lounge on Valencia St if you like cats. Even if you can't get a booking (tends to be busy weekend afternoons though you can reserve online), you can still look through the window and it has a gift shop with a lot of unique cat-themed items and art prints, some by local artists. And then all along Valencia Street there's a bunch of neat shops too like Arzimendi (a co-op bakery). I really like the pizza and I find the prices are fair since most places in SF will be more expensive/less fresh. There's also some thrift clothing stores like Eye Thrift and Buffalo Exchange, Needles & Pens (artsy gift shop), Silver Sprocket (comic shop with local artists' works), Smitten Ice Cream has some unique flavors (I once had corn flavor), and lots of cafes all along. Further north there's also a local art gallery (there's quite a lot actually) and \"Pirate Supply store\" that is pretty fun to look around, and I remember the person working there was super friendly and had good humor. He played a little game with people where you guess how many things were in a bottle.\n\nPier 39:  \nI would recommend Pier 39 specifically, which is different location from old Fisherman's Wharf. It's very touristy but even I as a local of 25+ years still enjoy coming here just for fun. There are sea lions that are always around nearby which is fun to watch their drama. There's also a small aquarium, mirror maze, and other fun boardwalk stuff. The clam chowder is good too, pretty much all the ones I've had were good (though if you want to save money, I recommend Boudin since it's much cheaper and still tastes good). Definitely recommend having at least once a Clam Chowder with Bread Bowl, because supposedly San Francisco is one of the best climates for sourdough bread, that makes it taste best.\n\nStonestown:  \nI recommend visiting Stonestown Mall if you have time. It's one of the most lively malls in the Bay Area, which is a very big contrast from say, Westfield Mall in downtown SF which has been dying out. Stonestown specializes in having lots of foodie places, especially if you like Asian food and novelty stores (my family is Japanese and Chinese and says often how it seems Stonestown is becoming more Asian over time lol). Kura Sushi I would recommend if you don't already have one where you're from, because it is the conveyor belt sushi which adds fun, and also one of the more affordable places for sushi here and good for sampling new things (not very cheap, but not TOO overpriced, but also not the freshest compared to high end places, but IMO decent. I'd say expect at least $30 per person, most plates are around $4 and most have 2 pc per plate).\n\nAs for safety, I recommend to be aware of your surroundings at all times. If your purse has no zipper or secure closure, always watch it or cover it with arm so you can feel it. I haven't experienced pick-pocketing personally, but it's always possibility if you're somewhere busy or off-guard.\n\nProbably the most likely of the bad things to happen to you as a solo woman is (usually just verbal) sexual harassment from creepy men which is more likely along the Mission St and Market St, and especially around/on public transit (even in suburb stations, my personal worst was at Daly City BART station). One of the common advice here is to put on a resting B face, wear sunglasses/headphones, sit at the front in bus/BART, maybe avoid transit past 6 or 7pm and call Uber/Lyft/Waymo instead, don't look at strange men, ignore strange men that approach/talk to you, and if they do, try to figure your escape plan like if there's somewhere with relatively normal-looking people try to go towards there and someone might be able to help you. If the guy is persistent and nobody can help, you can use your phone to call/pretend-call someone and act like you're in a hurry to get to them, bonus points if you do the call saying \"Hey babe, I'm almost there, how was your <insert martial arts> class?\", that could help intimidate the creep from following you. Generally you also wanna try walking at a brisk pace if you feel you're in a sketchy area or someone maybe following, think like businesswoman who is close to being late. Enter a business with an active staff if you can, if you're being followed and nobody else nearby can help.\n\nThere is definitely a world of difference in the frequency of sexual harassment based on whether it's daylight or not, to the point that from how often I experienced bad things in the evening/night, and how relatively little I experience in the daytime, my parents have insisted I call Uber/Waymo at night even though I feel bad about spending their money (it's on their card). I really wish there was some kind of evening/nighttime discount or monthly allowance for women to use rideshare apps/taxis, because it is literally just another layer of pink tax for women who don't want to experience more trauma, anxiety, or PTSD. :(\n\nIt sucks because experiences like that also do not help that Disabled people like me can get worse and worse each time it happens, worsens anxiety/social phobias/ptsd, and it happens quite regularly if you live along Mission st and can't drive and unlike me, lot of disabled don't get that support from parents can't possibly afford uber/lyft/waymo."

      "Yes, I have dietary restrictions. The times I felt left out were traveling in Asia, when I wanted to eat street food. I remember getting in a bit of a discussion with someone who also had severe restrictions and was about to travel in SE Asia. She prepared cards that told her restrictions in various languages. She was  like \"Now I can eat street food without any problems.\" Street food? Where the cook has probably just one wok and cooks everything with the same utensils? Good luck on that.",

      "I have an egg allergy. Not as restrictive as gluten, but a pain nevertheless. One of the key things I have learned to do is read accommodation reviews on Booking dot com to see what they serve for breakfast. The worst is not having anything to eat when you get up in the morning and you have to search for food before you can get started on your day. Also, I read restaurant menus online before I go out. As others have said, it helps to have access to a kitchen, or at least a fridge so you can store gluten-free options. I travelled with someone who cannot have gluten and she basically just ordered meat and fruits/veggies for meals and brought her own gluten free carbs from home. At least they are non-perishable!",

Why not look for places that has a good food market scene that you'd be interested in looking into? For example, you could deliberately aim for seaside towns with fish-based cuisines. You'll see a very different, maybe more mundane side than the touristy foods, but if you're anyway cooking, you may find it interesting.

    "selftext": "Before I get into the dirty detail details, here\u2019s a little bit about me. I am a 31 year old Black American queer woman. I am fairly experienced with solo travel, and am comfortable navigating new spaces. I also tend towards a high budget trip, as I value paying for comfortable and safe accommodations, as well as unique experiences. \n\nWhy do I include this information? Solo travel experiences vary widely by race, gender, age, and ethnicity to name a few things. I like to include information about the perspective from which I am coming, so that others who see themselves in my identities might appreciate this trip report. For those of you who come from a different background than me, perhaps you can read this report and appreciate some of the differences in our unique life experiences. If this information is not for you, then feel free to ignore it. \n\nSo now on all of the fun I had on this trip.\n\nThis trip took place in early August. \n\nBerlin - 4 days\n\nAccommodation - a hotel in Mitte. This was the perfect location. I was near a tube station and could get to any part of the city easily. \n\nDay 1 - I landed early on my first day, and was able to check into my hotel immediately. To avoid giving into the jet lag, I like to shower, walk around the neighborhood, and get a nice meal. The sunlight really helps me stay awake. \n\nI ended up heading to Museum Island and the Neues Museum. The museum had some really stunning pieces - but be ready to be reminded of imperialism as there were lots \nof art pieces and artifacts stolen from Africa. The showcase piece here is the bust of Nefertiti. This was really spectacular to see in person. The colors were vivid, and the room that they put it in did a great job of showcasing the beauty of this piece. The museum is near Berlin Cathedral, which is also beautiful. This was a great day one activity because I could roam around without needing to be anywhere, and it forced me to walk for a few hours.\n\nDay 2 - My trips tend to be very food, focused, and this one was no different. I took a Berlin street food tour throughout the Prenzlauerberg neighborhood. My guide was quite knowledgeable about Berlin\u2018s artist history. He infused a lot of discussion on how artists push the social agenda in the city. And let\u2019s not forget the  food. I\u2019m still dreaming of a vegan pistachio croissant that I had on the tour - and I don\u2019t even like pistachio like that. Yeah, it was that good.  \n\nAfter the tour, I went back to my hotel to rest. I was determined to hit the techno clubs while in Berlin. I forced myself to chill out, so I could have energy to go out later. I went to the famous KitKat Club for their Wednesday night Symbiotikka party. I showed up right at 10 when they opened and didn\u2019t have to wait in line for too long. Everyone was super friendly, and I met some cool people to dance with. There were also body painting and rope suspension demonstrations. I tend to stay sober when I solo travel. I felt like KitKat was a good place for sober partying, because there is so much to see and do that is not just. If you\u2019re looking for a sexier night out vibe, with a little bit of grunge, KitKat is a fun place for that. \n\nDay 3 - I went out to the Berlin Wall on this day. I\u2019ve been fascinated with history of the Berlin Wall, so it was really cool to see it. While walking along the wall and taking pictures, I listen to a podcast episode about it.  It was a really nice way to learn more while seeing this iconic sight. \n\nI also went to the Friedrichshain neighborhood. It had this alt, punk vibe that I really loved. I went in some shops and ate some food. Great area to just wander around. I visited Maaya which is a Black-Afro art space/dance hall/pool. It was empty when I went, but it was also the middle of the day. I definitely wanna go back in the evening when it\u2019s probably more happening. The space itself was beautiful.\n\nDay 4 - All my vacations have to include a spa retreat. For my last day in Berlin, I went to Vabali Spa. It is a nude spa with lots of saunas, pools, and other amenities. You pay one fee and can hop around all day. There were a few guided experiences. My favorite was the sound bath in a comfy meditation room.\n\nAfter I was sufficiently relaxed, I ended my night with dinner and a show. For dinner I went to Night Kitchen. They have this incredible menu option called dinner with friends. You give them your dietary restrictions and preferences, and they bring you food until you tell them to stop. I sat at the bar while eating my meal. The bartenders kept bringing me free shots and I had a lovely time chatting with them while chowing down on some delicious plates. If you are a food person, I highly recommend this spot. \n\nAfter dinner, I took the train over to Tempelhofer Feld for the Berlin circus festival. I attended their queer circus show. I really loved the beautiful costuming, the impressive acrobatics, and the comedic host.\n\nI spent a few nights in D\u00fcsseldorf with a friend after Berlin. As this was not solo, I am admitting the discussion of the city. now on to London! \n\nLondon - 2 days\n\nAccommodation - rented a room in a flat in SoHo. \n\nIt was cheaper for me to fly back to the eastern United States from London than Berlin. So I took a few quick days to see the city. This isn\u2019t my first time in London. However, the first time I went, I was in a bad mental health space. This trip was really important Because it felt like me reclaiming a lot of bad memories I had with the city. After the trip, I really love London and can\u2019t wait to come back. \n\nDay 1 - I arrived early and spent my evening walking around SoHo. I visited shops and bars, ate baked goods, and otherwise had a gay ole time. I really loved staying in this neighborhood because of its proximity to things, as well as the queer vibe. \n\nDay 2 - I only had one full day in London so I wanted to make it count. I started in the morning in Camden market. I had some delicious Chinese food from a stall. I also picked up some coasters from a local artist. From there, I hopped on the bus to go to the Design Museum. They had a Barbie special exhibit which I absolutely loved. It was really cool to see the evolution of Barbie, learn more about her marketing and manufacturing, as well as relive the nostalgia of my childhood. There were also some cool exhibits on information design, which is a special interest of mine. Highly recommend this museum if you want something a little different. \n\nThat evening, the theater nerd and signed me was so excited to see a show. I saw Cabaret in London\u2019s West End. I have long loved the show, but I have yet to see it in person. As expected, I found myself sobbing during the musical. The singing was amazing and I loved the choreography. Highly recommend the show for all my traveling theater nerds. \n\nOverall, this was a fantastic trip and I cannot wait to go back to both cities. Berlin just had this vibe about that I loved. If you like a bit of the alt, artsy scene, then I recommend the city. And London, of course is a travelers paradise  - you can do anything in the city. Stay in SoHo, you won\u2019t regret it.  ",

Directions, a good place to eat, if they speak English (or your native language) etc. Asking in their native language makes a huge difference as an opener to start a conversation, even if they do know your language. Idk how but I always end up meeting locals and just hanging out with them. I like off the beaten path travel. Just be genuine and friendly. It\u2019s gotten me friends all over the world! ",

Got my ass kicked in street ping pong by some kids in Cairo, kicked a bunch of kids\u2019 asses in billiards in Alduba, played soccer with some kids elsewhere... list goes on.\n\nSo, avoiding tours, chasing local women, wandering aimlessly, sports and probably some stuff I\u2019m missing.\n\nAh yeah, and hitchhiking.

I'd highly recommend something like this, it was definitely a highlight of my trip. \n\nWhile in a city I like to find walking streets, markets and parks to get a feel for a city and the locals. ",
      "Many years ago when I was around 14/15 I went on holiday with my older sister and her boyfriend at the time to Crete. There was a specific restaurant we loved and would always go in. We all got on well with the staff, especially the pizza chef who would always wave hello when we walked past and come over and chat with us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's these posters all over the town, but the info was all in greek so we didn't understand what they were about. Anyway, one day, the chef comes over to us and asks if we're going to that event. He told us it was amazing, that we had to go and we had to 'learn the dance'. We didn't know what it meant but I remember standing up and him teaching me this dance with my feet. So, we ask him how to get to this event and he points up to a hill with a little village on and says \"go up there tonight and follow the music. You'll find it\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUncertain, but excited, that night we wandered up to the village which was beautifully mapped with old stone buildings and narrow tiled alleys twisting and turning in every direction. Then we heard it. The music. Guitars, drums, voices, laughter. We followed the music just like he said and ended up in this square outside a local school decorated in lights. There were tables of local food and a band playing and locals dancing in a circle. Around 100 people were there in total. In the circle of people, everyone is doing that same dance the chef showed me earlier. Then we notice the chef in that circle. Then he notices us and come running over. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"You found it!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe pulls us by the arm to join the circle and we try to do the dance too. After the song is over he invites us to meet his family. They offer us some of the food and we just have a lovely time there. It was so magical and unexpected and felt like something out of a film. Unfortunately my sister and her boyfriend stopped enjoying it after just a short while, maybe an hour. So we had to leave as, being as young as I was, I couldn't stay alone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remember the awe I felt though, how special it felt and how immersive with this local experience it was. The lights, the dancing, the smiles of the people. I watched the locals dance and their hair flow as they span around in the warm evening heat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLeaving was sad, I felt my heart was still there as we wandered down the hill and the music got quieter and quieter again. But I was so appreciative of it happening and it opened my eyes to the kind of experiences I want to spend my life chasing. These moments make my heart feel big and my body feels full with joy, life and appreciation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I guess the way it began was just being friendly with a local. Obviously this wont happen with every local but sometimes some magical stuff just happens.",

    "selftext": "Hello, \n\nI am loosely planning a future solo travel trip. I will be leaving my company and get a nice severance/bonus/payout for it. \n\nThese are the places I have **already been before**: All the Balkans/Yugoslavia (only Istanbul in Turkiye), the Canary Islands of Spain, Germany/Austria, Vietnam, US/CAN (cities and national park areas). I am from the USA. \n\nI am evaluating the following places for a 2-month solo trip for all of May, June, and all of July. \n\nMy criteria are for it to be kind of a challenging trip, logistically. I have more fun in places like Albania and Vietnam than I do in places like the UK or the Netherlands. \n\nI am looking for novel experiences. Big open outdoors areas and strange old ways of living. My most cherished travel memories are hiking in the Peaks of the Balkans with shepherds on pre-roman sheep trail, riding a moped / hiking around Tenerife finding abandoned guancho caves/haciendas/hamlets, doing overnight backpacking trips in the US in national parks, and sailing through the Panama Canal, riding around the Ha Giang Loop in Vietnam. \n\nI like the adventure aspects. And I also like megacities. I don't care much for the stuff between. \n\nI am 29, I speak English and Spanish (like B1, B2, pretty good when travelling, I take frequent lessons in my day-to-day). \n\n  \nThese are the trips I am considering. \n\n1.) Southeast Asia trip which will start in Singapore, then up Malaysia, then Thailand, then Cambodia, then Laos. This will be the cheapest but I fear that May, June, July will be bad months to do this. But SEA food is 10/10, so. \n\n2.) North Africa Trip. I'd fly to Marrakech, take the new high speed trains (I love trains) to Essaouira, Fes, etc., then cross Gibraltar to fly to Algiers, then see Tunis, then see Cairo, Alexandria, and fly back. This will allow me to hike Mt. Toubkal, which I really want to do, and it would be cheap. I will unfortunately not be able to visit Libya, and I may need to have some kind of concern with Egypt's border with Palestine/Israel/all that. This would be pretty cheap but not as cheap as SEA, and I also fear that May, June, July would be bad months for this. But spending time in the Sahara desert seems very cool. \n\n3.) Nepal, Bhutan. I am a very good hiker and would love to spend the time hiking in Nepal. I have no ambitions of summitting Everest, but I'd love to do the Annapurna Circuit and many other hiking trails there. The three months gives me a lot of time for acclimation and hiking. I also love Nepali food. Bhutan is a very rare place to get to visit, and I love the architectural oddities and the remoteness of it. I could probably spend some time in India as well since I may get bored of hiking in Nepal after a month or so. \n\n4.) The 'Stans. and Georgia, Armeia, Azerbaijan. I would fly into Tblisi, and ride my touring bike through Armenia and then to Baku, and then take the ferry to love to see Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, riding my bike through all of these countries over the course of three months, with no firm plan, until I eventually fly back. I've only done bike touring a bit, in the US, but I do thru-hiking a lot so I am not new to sleeping in bivvys. This would probably be more cheap as well, but with a lot less comfort. \n\n5.) West Africa. The most expensive of all the options. Fly into Dakar, see the Gambia, see Bissau, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Lagos. I'd love to see Lagos because I love megacities. This would be the most expensive and the most convoluted, and I'd probably have to fly everywhere the entire time. This would also have the least amount of solo-travel infra and few hostels to pick from. \n\n  \nSome other options with less time off (which wouldn't earn me more money), would be to fly into Nairobi, do some safaris, hike Mt. Kilamanjaro, or to spend a month in Peru in Lima and then Cusco and then doing the longest hike to Macchu Picchu I can find. Or visiting the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.\n\nI have no interest in going to what are perhaps more obvious choices in Japan and Korea and Colombia because they are too expensive and too logistically simple, and for that reason I want to save those for when I am older and travelling with a partner or a family. \n\nIts a lot more fun to do the harder countries when your young and have the cartilege in your knees. \n\nDo any of you have any other suggestions?\n\nSorry for the long post, and thanks for reading.

      "These all sound like amazing trips.\n\nSeasonality and weather seem pretty important to bear in mind, though. North Africa in June/July will be brutal, particularly given you want to hike and probably head into the Sahara. In Nepal, the monsoon season is June to August - as it is in India, so I'm guessing that's not a great time for hiking either.\n\nI like your 'Stans plan but I would say that the Caucasus overland through to Tajikistan is probably too much and too far for three months! Aktau (Kazakh side of the Caspian ferry) to, say, Bukhara or Samarkand is 1000 miles of desert in 40C summer heat, and the Ustyurt plateau is pretty much uninhabited without any food or water stops. (Just an Uzbek black site military prison at Jasliq...)\n\nAt least a month in the Caucasus might be better - for hiking, go north of Tbilisi into Kazbegi National Park, and check out the [Transcaucasian Trail](https://www.campcaucasus.com/post/transcaucasian-trail-hike). See the note below about geopolitical instability in the region, though.\n\nIf the ferry's a must, I'd then take the train through Kazakhstan and into Tashkent, and then start cycling again once you're in eastern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan etc."

      "One of the main ways I choose where to travel is by the quality of street food. I eat it for every meal. In countries where there's a strong street food culture (i.e. Asia) you can find healthier options. It's way cheaper than cooking for myself.",
      "Grocery stores are usually a good bet food wise. Everyplace has something, even a bodega. Most have predone salads and fruits. I've grabbed a bag of carrots and hummus for a meal on the go, some have warm food bars with soups and meals usually healthier and cheaper than fast food.",

I also like to get food from local markets, delis in the grocery stores/markets, etc.  I try to completely avoid fast food and limit restaurant meals.  \n\nIf I'm doing a road trip, I pack an ice chest with food that travels well, and then restock at grocery stores.\n\nI love to try new foods when I travel, but still try to keep to things that are not too hard on the stomach.",
      "I only eat out when travelling. My solo travels that lasted longer than a week were all in Asia though, and the places that I visited generally had healthy cuisines. \n\n When I've travelled e.g. two weeks in the USA in a group my stomach generally doesn't mind as breakfast and lunch are often not excessive. Just breakfast food and sandwiches for lunch. Eating healthy in the USA is a bit challenging though.\n\nBut you can try and find some diversity in what you eat or alternative healthy options. In a North American city there must be places selling Poke bowls for example. Or a decent Thai place. Or a place selling soup and salad. Doesn't help the budget a ton but it's healthier.",
      "My thoughts:  \n\n\nFood is in the top 3 (along with people and nature) reasons to travel at all... If your reason is your stomach, it will be wise to drink a can of coke regularly... that helped me and a friend in India a lot. I think it's a matter of acceptance at first; you'll be sick once or twice during a trip anyway, but your stomach definitely gets used to a different way of eating. You should just know the basic rules of eating while travelling. A few:  \n\\-If you buy fruit, make sure it's not cut up into pieces. You dont know what is cut with the knife before.  \n\\-Don't get yourselves salads. Washed with tap water which will make you sick.  \n\\-Choose for less meat more often. Meat will be a big reason for becoming sick.  \n\n\n If it's cost driven, I would always say go for the cheapest options around eating out (streetfood, local food etc). I can give a whole rant about how awesome the concept of eating is, how it's grounding you and making it able to share love with people who speak another language (go through any Bourdain quotes).\n\nIm sure this is not the answer on your question you were looking for, but wanted to share my thoughts anyways :).",

      "I feel like every time I stayed at a hostel with a kitchen it\u2019s always been busy during meal times; a lot of solo travelers in hostels are frugal so they cook a lot. That is the smartest thing to do financially if you\u2019re staying in one place for a long time, however maybe not if you\u2019re only staying a day or two because you may buy more groceries than you can cook. It also depends on location. Food is very expensive some places (like the US) but much cheaper other places.\n\nI personally don\u2019t like hostel kitchens, I get stressed cooking around other people. However, most days I\u2019ll make toast with peanut butter and banana for breakfast and instant coffee at the kitchen which saves money on 1 meal. My rule is to never spend more than $5 USD on breakfast.  In Airbnb\u2019s I\u2019ll cook for myself more if it has a kitchen. \n\nI also try to buy cheap but good local food - in France you can get large baguette sandwiches from a boulangerie for 5 euro, in China you can get delicious noodles also for super cheap. It\u2019s okay to splurge on a real meal occasionally but I try to save that for once every two days (some may think that\u2019s too much) but it offers a good balance for me.

I\u2019m currently obsessed with Greek salads. A month ago I was making crackers with tuna, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, chili peppers, scallions, and hot sauce every day for lunch.\n\nI\u2019m not a person who needs a whole lot of variety on a day to day basis, so once I\u2019ve found something I can easily find the ingredients for wherever I\u2019m staying, I usually stick with that thing until I\u2019ve grown tired of it.\n\nI will say that this is all *because* I\u2019m on such a long trip.

      "I go to Asia and eat the same as at home when I can the food pyramid with the correct macros, fruit, veg, pulses, mushrooms and when I can get it dairy, eggs, fish, meat, and booze. I have never got an apartment but some do, but I think I would find trying to cook and clean up a bit counter productive and if the kitchen was basic it would be dissatisfying. Eating out does become wearing (which sounds so ungratefully indulgently Western and to many would be their idea of paradise) interacting all the time for food, and I do buy things for the room, yak cheese, snacks, proteins, fruit for breakfast. I have a cup boiler so I don\u2019t have to interact with humanity at all until I have had a nice cup of tea inevitably on a terrace outside my room with a lovely view where I can see the city or village or even nothing waking up while I do, but then the hunger descends and I go out for a feast and then after stand up and walk out without doing the washing up, which does have an upside. Eating out in the West is a very involved slow overworked experience, I hate it and I hate the food,  it is expensive which is ok if you are getting something that is worth it, but most of the time it is just simply overpriced a total rip off. That is partly due to greed of the owner, but also a product of the involved experience I mentioned, where preparing and serving food is turned into a bureaucratic inefficient nightmare. Where I go is super relaxed and informal, often one guy with one burner and one pan making incredible food considering the space facilities and equipment, and I nearly always eat spicy healthyish food in a lovely setting like a garden or by a river if I can. I like how the cooking takes place near and around you, I beware of food from hidden processes, and so I never get food poisoning except when I eat out at home.\n\nYou will struggle to travel and eat satisfyingly in USA I think, just as I would in UK, so I wouldn\u2019t bother, even if I felt that I could trust them not to serve dirty food which makes me ill.",

      "I'll usually make something simple for breakfast if it's not included (eggs, maybe some kind of protein, and bread), and use the same bread to make sandwiches for lunch - typical food for me back home. Dinner is my biggest meal so I have the opportunity to eat out then rather than breakfast/lunch. \n\nExcept in Australia. I think I ate pies 3x a day pretty regularly...\n\nEdit: also I feel like as an American, I have far fewer issues eating takeout or restaurant meals outside the US. I agree that a lot of food is very greasy in the states.",
      "I usually go to the grocery store and stock up on healthy snacks and small meals.  Sandwiches at coffee shops or delis for lunch are often cheaper than full service restaurants.  I\u2019ll also go to really nice places and splurge on a fancy salad or get 2 appetizers and some wine so I can experience the food options but with a smaller, lighter, less expensive meal.",
      "I struggle with trying to be budget cautious on trips but also I hear about alot of famous restaurants in cities and wanna experience them. I ate at 7-11's alot in Japan they got quality food for reasonable prices",
      "I have a genuine love for canned food and it has really helped with the budget. I love tuna in olive oil and sardines in tomato sauce. Actually, visiting a Portuguese friend in Lisbon is how I learned about how delicious tuna in olive oil is. I also had amazing tinned sardines in Norway \ud83d\ude02 King Oscar was the brand I believe. \nBut yes in general I can\u2019t think of any hostels I\u2019ve ever been in without a kitchen. I feel like that\u2019s pretty standard to be able to cook. Not sure about hotels but I feel like getting a private room in a hostel is a good compromise.",
      "I will eat out for lunch and dinner every day. But I usually go to cheaper places. For me, food and going out to eat is one of the most essential things about travel. If I were travelling to the U.S. alone I would probably look to eat at street vendors more often, and maybe get a healthy salad from the grocery store every once in a while.",
      "I have a small travel cattle (water boiler) with me, plus a Vietnamese coffee filter. So I have always coffee with me, tea, instant meals, soup..\n\nAnd I eat a lot of fresh fruit From the markets and street food",
      "With a bit of planning, it is quite easy to eat healthy while travelling. It does depend a bit on the region, but let's say Europe or North America.\n\nWhen travelling in those regions, I generally eat out for lunch (unless I'm taking a rest day), although if the weather is really good and there is a park nearby, I might visit a supermarket salad bar (or get a ready-made veggie salad and supplement it with cold cuts) and then have myself a picnic. Eating out, I try to go for the healthy options rather than fast food, and local food rather than international. If there is street food and it smells enticing, I'll go for that.\n\nI shop for my food in supermarkets and generally eat yogurt and fruit for breakfast in my room or the communal eating space if there is one. I'll have vegetables (tomato, cucumber, green salad), bread and cold cuts for supper, or I might buy a sandwich in a supermarket and supplement that with fruit. These things (except some cold cuts) will keep unrefrigerated for a few hours even if its hot in the room.\n\nOn travel days I  eat what and where it is convenient, often in caf\u00e9s (go for the healthier options) or occasionally fast food places (I have a weakness for MacDonalds hashbrowns and Egg MacMuffins and their coffee isn't terrible).\n\nWhen I stayed in hostels that had refrigerators and cooking facilities, I would go shopping in the evening and cook myself a quick meal for supper, and maybe buy bacon and eggs to cook myself a hearty breakfast for a change. I have found that if I load up at breakfast, I often don't need to eat again until in the afternoon, so if the hotel/guest-house/B&B I'm staying in offers breakfast, I'll go for that. A full English isn't exactly healthy, but it has staying power and is energy-rich.",
      "I guess this also depends on how expensive the countries which you are visiting are?\n\nWhen I was travelling in Vietnam, I ate out all the time because it was so affordable to. It probably isnt very healthy though because I definitely did not get enough greens and vegetables, but Ill buy a juice for a dollar or so occasionally.\n\nI am travelling to Spain soon for several months, and I plan to buy granola and fruits/salads from the supermarkets for breakfast and dinner everyday. I want to eat out for lunch, and I plan to have healthy and cheap food for my other meals",
      "I get super sick of eating out so, as much as possible, i stay in places where I have at the least a mini fridge. then i can at least do sandwiches, cheese and crackers, salad, dips and veg, etc. \n\ni do still eat out because food is a bit part of travel for me, but it's generally max 1 meal a day - usually lunch - and even then not every day. Some of that is location dependent though as there are some places where I can eat out every meal and be perfectly content (looking at you italy).\n\nnote that eating out doesn't necessarily mean a restaurant. i'm generally in europe so there are a lot of bars and sandwich shops where you can just get a sandwich or something similar for lunch on the go.",
      "I usually try and make breakfast and lunch myself and then find great local things to eat for dinner. Someone just street food, other times good restaurants. I love having something planned for dinner so I know there\u2019s great food waiting at the end of the day so I make sure to plan, book, reserve etc this part of the day nearly every day. \n\nI find, like you, that if you eat out every meal you get next to zero vegetables or fruit and end up feeling really gross by the end of Few weeks. This is made worse in some areas where restaurant food is cured meat heavy or just really carby and dense. \n\nI definitely feel way better making those two meals. And if cooking facilities are scarce, you can usually get something decent from a grocery store to cut up etc on your travels.",
      "Depends. Travelling through Europe you\u2019ll take a big chunk out of your savings eating out every day.\n\nTravelling through Asia, I was there for a considerable amount of time and ate street food basically every day and it was ridiculously cheap.",
      "I take very long trips, like 6 months, to a year or more. \n\nYes! Eating out quickly loses its allure. Unlike in the West (I'm from Canada) restaurant food is usually very unicultural: if you are in Japan, you don't go out for Japanese food, as it's all Japanese! You just go out for food!\n\nI love Japanese food - all of it! But after a month of nothing but, it gets tiring. \n\nIn Canada you can go out of Italian, Greek, Thai, Indian, Mexican, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Ethiopian or any other kind of cuisine. In most other countries you cannot. \n\nYes! Travellers cook all the time. Every hostel has a kitchen for that reason. Many travellers are on a tight budget, and save tons of cash by buying food and cooking it themselves. \n\nThe things you miss the most are usually the simplest: toast and cheese/jam, cereal for breakfast, tuna fish sandwiches! \n\nFresh fruits and vegetables are usually available in every city, and are usually very cheap. They are also super fun to shop for, as you go through outdoor markets with locals.\n\nDoing a combination of take-out and home cooking can work well: buy your cooked meat dish, and then buy and cook your own vegetables or salad to go with it.  \n\nFind a go-to food which you can find anywhere. Mine is yogurt, fruit and granola. If you don't have a kitchen, a fridge in your room helps a lot too. \n\nMany big stores have pre-made food, or microwave/frozen. \n\nFinally, it really depends where on earth you are. If you are in India, it is a very different experience than travelling in France, or Peru. \n\nSometimes it is a matter of shoving something down your gullet to fill the hole, until a better option presents itself. \n\nTravelling pushes us beyond our boundaries, and food/eating requires we are highly adaptable. \n\nRemember: you eat to live, rather than live to eat. \n\nM"

    "selftext": "First solo international trip (32F) - was recently diagnosed with a shellfish allergy. I spent the first few days being EXTREMELY CAREFUL - no restaurants, just pre-packaged 7-11 stuff that I know is safe and street food that I can see being made. \n\nI got cocky, I tried a soup and a stew without knowing the base. Fish. I immediately felt sick, rush of panic, ran to the hotel. Grabbed an epipen and the hotel staff helped me administer. It took like 10 mins for them to find an ambulance that would pick up an English speaker while I\u2019m nodding in and out and spinning. Once in the ambulance, I was basically held me for 45 mins until they could find a hospital that would take an English speaker. I started to get bad again and needed a second epipen shot and they wouldn\u2019t let me do it until I got to the hospital. I was begging for it as the room started spinning - it was traumatic. \n\nFinally at the hospital, English speaking is sparse but they\u2019ve given me the meds I need. I have to be admitted and stay overnight for 2 days. When they asked if I knew anyone in the country, I burst into tears and said no - no emergency contact. It is harrowing making trying to communicate important medical things with such little English speaking, and I have even felt like some people may not be taking me seriously because I am a tattooed, panicking gaijin who has only been here 3 days. \n\nI knew allergies were a struggle in Japan, but they just tried to serve me miso soup in the hospital without knowing whether there is shellfish in it. Has anyone else encountered health crises abroad? Considering cutting my trip short after this, I was supposed to stay for a whole month :( advice, solidarity etc welcome",

      "Trying to manage a severe food allergy (especially something like shellfish in Japan, an extremely fish heavy country) when you don't speak/read the language seems especially challening.\n\nDo you have more epipens (and perhaps benadryl)?\n\nIf you have more epipens with you (or can get more), I'd stay, with the expectation that I'm only eating the 711/pre-packaged food route from now on, and food tourism isn't part of my trip. I might only make exceptions if I met someone who spoke decent English and Japanese and understood how severe my allergy was and could communicate with a food place if we went out together.",
      "I have the same allergy and the same problem in Japan. Some things you can do to manage it include: seek out vegetarian food (ask for 'Buddhist' food so it's clear); stick to dishes that never have shellfish (for example chicken or tonkatsu ramen, chicken katsu, onigiri that aren't specifically shellfish-filled, sweets); and always, always ask - use gtranslate if you have to. For right now, stay calm and ask to be put on the vegetarian/Buddhist menu (they should have one) to avoid any further incidents while in hospital. And don't make any decisions about what to do with the rest of your trip while you're panicking.\n\nAlso get another epipen and carry it with you, always. The faster you can respond, the less likely you are to have a serious issue.",
      "Can\u2019t thank you all enough for your kind words! I have encountered a lot of compassion in the hospital as well, and trying to focus on those glimmers of kindness. Lesson learned: for now, I will absolutely eat vegan/vegetarian/buddhist menu, and speak VERY clearly upfront. Failing that, tbh, 7-11 and fast food will be my new best friend. \n\nThis trip (and this thread!) have shown me that it\u2019s okay to reach out and to rely on the kindness of strangers even in crisis. This has been a tremendous challenge for me in my life until now, and I feel like this is one of many tests that solo travel can give you to push yourself open to others. I don\u2019t want to give up - this is my dream trip! And if that means egg sandwiches for 26 more days than by god I\u2019ll do it.",
      "don't cut your trip short but i do recommend eating vegan food in the future. i spent a month in japan and didn't find it hard to eat vegan in a variety of places. you can also download allergy cards that are translated to show staff at restaurants.\n\ni'm sorry this happened to you. people can be very kind though so please give it another shot. google translate can be very helpful. i hope reddit can at least lend you a sympathetic ear for now as that does sound very traumatising. there is plenty of positivity to be found in japan as well. stay tough x\n\nedit; this is the international hospital in tokyo; https://hospital.luke.ac.jp/eng/index_sp.html",
      "Fellow anaphylaxis sufferer here, though to peanuts, not shellfish. Sorry you're having this experience on your first solo trip. Being in hospital abroad on your own is no fun, but you will get through it, learn from your error, and have a good story for your friends back home :) \n\nI lived in Burma for a year with a bad peanut allergy (it's very common food ingredient there, including as a cooking oil) and even though I speak the language, food was a considerable stress. Based on the fact that you don't speak Japanese and that you now know how difficult it is to get help, spending a month there is indeed likely to be very stressful. That doesn't mean it can't be done, just that you need to manage your expectations. You can still have great experiences on the road, but you need a solid gameplan when it comes to food.\n\nThe details of your allergy written down in Japanese to show at every food place is essential. You won't be able to rely on street food and 7-11 for a month, and I'm sure you're aware that shellfish is an ingredient in the ubiquitous fish sauce that is used to flavour many dishes, including those w/o fish. Chicken, meat, veggie and egg dishes should be okay to explore in restaurants, as long as you are able to communicate your allergy properly - and one to two lines written in Japanese by a local can do this for you. (Perhaps one of the staff at the hospital can help you with this.)\n\nDo you have enough epipens and anti-histamines to see you through at least one more frightening fish encounter? If not, and you can't get any, or don't fancy playing Russian roulette every mealtime, then there's absolutely no shame in heading home, or to another country where communication or diet is not going to be the same issue. It really is not worth risking your life for. However, if you do, and you are willing to plan your meals and carry out the necessary preliminary checks & warnings at each mealtime, you are good to go, fellow traveller.\n\nTake care out there",
      "Hi OP I went through something very similar last summer. Seafood and nut allergies but tuna is fine which makes soups a little easier for me. I had a set list of dishes I would order (skewers, chicken katsu, chicken karaage, sukiyaki udon, and tonkatsu ramen for reference). \n\nAround 5 days into the trip I had a packaged melon pan from 7-11 for breakfast. I assumed it was fine bc I had just had one the day before but this particular brand used a little bit of almond flour. Immediate reaction, tried to self treat with Benadryl etc but eventually knew I had to go to the hospital. \n\nI was with my family but none of us speak Japanese so my dad was trying to contact different hospitals but none of them would take me. Eventually the hotel staff called me an ambulance and got in with me to help translate. Took a good 30 minutes or so and I just remember thinking \u201cshouldn\u2019t we be going by now?\u201d Meanwhile my symptoms are getting worse and I\u2019m just watching my heart rate on the monitor and panicking. Totally different experience than in the US where I got epi from an urgent care and they still made me take an ambulance to the hospital ASAP. \n\nAt the hospital I was alone in the room with a ton of different nurses/doctors that were speaking to me in Japanese while hooking me up to the IVs and leads. I didn\u2019t speak to a doctor who knew English until much later but those first moments were extremely stressful with no way to translate. \n\nI don\u2019t have much advice, just solidarity. I stayed after the hospital visit and continued to eat at restaurants. Stayed far away from baked goods for the rest of the trip and for dishes I would do a test bite and wait 5-10 mins before continuing to eat.

Most travel insurance programs come with travel \"assistance\" which is literally things like finding you medical help in your native language, translating for you, etc. Plus they could confirm if your policy will cover an early return for medical issues.\n\n\nOne tip: speaking as a person with many many allergies, celiac plus food intolerances, always research and map out the food. It's a giant pain in the ass, but it is unfortunately part of your life now. And you may have to rethink visiting certain places because finding food will be challenging.\n\n\nFor me, most of Asia will be complicated to visit because I am celiac and am allergic to soy and sesame + many common preservatives found in processed food. It sucks, but it'll be very challenging for me to find safe food in many/most Asian countries. For you, you need to be wary of seafood loving cultures and also of sauces. So many sauces have unexpected bases, like dried shrimp, dried scallop. I know that's in XO sauce and possibly others, though I cannot remember if the Japanese use them too. \n\n\nIt sucks. I feel for you. I hope your insurance company can help (or credit card company if you have one with travel rewards - they might have the same assistance services). Stay safe and I'm so sorry you have to deal with all of this.",
      "It's not worth cutting your trip short over, just be very careful what you eat. There's an awful lot to see and do in Japan that doesn't involve food.\n\nI think at that point I would just eat food I bought in the supermarket or in American fast food places so I know what I'm getting. No shame in that when you have a good reason. Or maybe look for very touristy restaurants near tourist attractions where there are likely to be some English speaking waiters.",
      "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe now and you\u2019ve been cared for properly. \n\nPlease take this as a lesson to make sure you have a translation to hand that you show everyone (waiters/chefs etc). \n\nI have a life threatening allergy to nuts and whilst Japan was fine for me when I visited thetr, I had to be very very careful in other SE Asian countries I travelled to. \n\nFish sauce and other oyster sauces are very commonly used as bases in Japanese meals. It\u2019s VERY important you show an accurate translation in restaurants, and tbh I\u2019m really shocked that you felt it was ok to not do this. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that some people are saying you should come home. Ive travelled to Vietnam and Indonesia with a life threatening nut allergy when nuts are pretty much used in everything and I\u2019ve been fine when I\u2019ve showed my translation card or phone with the translation on. \n\nIf in any doubt, Italian food is extremely popular in Japan (I think 2nd most common type of cuisine), so you should be fine there. There are tonnes of Italian restaurants so you should be able to find them easily. \n\nPlease take care of yourself and be vigilant!",
      "Use Google Translate that can translate speech.\n\nMy friends learned that from an 80 yr old Japanese man. They experienced a very heavy storm were coming  and all public transport closed, so they couldn't leave town and there were no available room. They managed all this thanks to GT, took local busses that ran, so they could get to a village some distance away where they could stay during the storm.\n\nMy husband had also shellfish allergy, I hope that you get the needed help and not at least food without shellfish!",
      "Going to vegetarian or vegan restaurants only is basically a good advise, but it is not 100% foolproof! At least in Vietnam, they may use fish sauce for everything without thinking it contains something non-vegan. They use it instead of salt: in Vietnam I've prepared a banana flower salad which contained fish sauce! \n\nIn Japan, fish sauce or daishi or bonito may possibly just something they spice the food with. If you say \"no shellfish / fish / creatures from the sea\", it is a completely different concept than something in a bottle that you sprinkle on food. That is why you must have a card stating clearly what exactly you cannot eat.\n\nTo OP: you are in good hands now, take time to relax and have a deep breath. Then continue your trip in Japan which is a truly unique contry. All the best to you!",
      "I am very similar to you: I have severe allergies to shellfish and seafod + nuts. I have been to Japan twice as well as about 20 other countries. You can google food cards - an Australian allergy organization has a great one for japanese. Download it, print, and highlight it. The Japanese were extremely accomodating with the food cards. I presented it at every restaurant, including chains. One curry chain brought out their massive allergy book for me to read myself, and we say peanut oil was in all the sauces. Kinda sucked I had to skip out, but it saved me from making a rash choice. Admittedly, last year when I was there, I had to eat mcdonalds twice, and a few convenience store meals when options were tough to find. My husband went and found sushi and other fish meals while I napped, so he didn't miss out.  \n\n\nYou need to live by those allergy cards.",
      "girl it's ok, feel better first. what i would do is call your embassy and ask for their help in dealing with this immediate health crisis. in particular ask for their help in communicating with the hospital about your allergy, the last thing you want is being served more shellfish. \n\nafter that is taken care of i would suggest for your own safety it's honestly better to leave japan if you're this level allergic to shelfish and fish. the basic soup stock that is in EVERYTHING is japan is called \"dashi\" and the base of it is fish. almost everything single item is made with it, there's not even any guarantee items from 7-11 don't have it also. or if you want to stay, change your accomodation to one with a kitchen and make all your own food. \n\nit's super scary to have health problems abroad so i totally understand you being terrified. but you can get through this and it will be ok.",
      "I just got back from Japan a couple months ago and practically ate only American style food or 7/11 sandwiches to avoid having to dance around my shellfish allergy at restaurants. Next time, get a card that has your allergies translated on it and you unfortunately you have to avoid all food with broth",
      "Contact your embassy NOW. Get yourself well, and if your allergy is this severe, you need to go home and get well. \n\nIn the future, with such a severe allergy you need to plan better. The emergency phone numbers for the embassy should be programmed in your phone. You need to establish an emergency contact and a support system on what happens if something goes wrong. \n\nI know you're very ill and probably want support, but I don't think you took this very seriously. \n\nMaybe I'm not understanding, but how could you go to a country where you don't speak the language or at least have your allergy written down, no emergency contact, no embassy numbers, and not inquiring about something that could kill you? It seems really reckless. I implore you, as someone who also has food allergies, learn your allergens in the language, and take your health more seriously.",

When are they letting you out of the hospital? If you already paid for everything remain calm, take a day to reassess before calling this trip short. You can still make the best of it if you\u2019re up to it. Just eat vegan, and don\u2019t freak out. Can you find places with more Americanized food? Don\u2019t feel bad the 7-11 kept me alive for 2 days before we found places I felt comfortable eating at. I also had someone teach me the phrase \u201c \u2019m allergic to peanuts\u201d in Thai. Can you use google translate or DeepL so people can better assist you?",
      "[Here is a resource from the Japan Living Guide about navigating food allergies while in Japan.](https://www.realestate-tokyo.com/living-in-tokyo/food/allergies-food-labels/)",
      "I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. They really aren\u2019t very careful of allergies in Japan, and it\u2019s up to the individual to watch out for themselves. Going forward, you should just assume that any food with broth or soup will be fish-based. It\u2019s called \u201cKatsuo dashi\u201d and is very common. If you tell them you have an allergy, they\u2019ll pay more attention, but often they just aren\u2019t very careful. \n\nMake sure to pronounce allergy as \u201caller-GI\u201d with a hard G instead of a J sound. That\u2019s how they say it in Japanese. \n\n\nThey can be really bad about accepting English speakers at hospitals. I\u2019ve heard similar stores to yours, and it took me years to create a personal list of English-friendly dentists and doctors in Tokyo. \n\nAs a general rule of thumb, you can call Himawari: https://www.himawari.metro.tokyo.jp/qq13/qqport/tomintop/other/fks240.php\n\nThey have English speakers on hand to direct you to hospitals that can handle non-English speaking patients.",
      "You can use this and check off fish and crustaceans. Maybe store it in your phone, if printer isn\u2019t accessible. \nhttp://foodallergycardjapan.com",
      "I visited Japan and also have a shellfish allergy. \n\nI had a card, but I also was with a guy who was Japanese and could explain at restaurants what the issue was. \n\nIf I was on my own I only ate packaged foods, or things I knew were 100% safe. \n\nMy hotel was very accommodating and was able to provide packed lunches for me too.",
      "wow, what a scary, awful experience. so sorry.\n\nwould love an update later about how the rest of your trip panned out, I'm also really curious how much 2 days in the hospital costs for a foreigner.\n\nMy dietary restrictions made eating in Japan a huge pain, and I wasn't even allergic to fish. I ate a lot of sweets just because they were safe foods for me. I know Japan is a country known for its incredible food and seafood, and I did have some really good meals there, but for me food was always stressful. that said, I did 6 months and had an incredible time, and would go back in a heartbeat. I think you can figure it out and have a great rest of your trip.",
      "If you have a severe food allergy, you really need to cook for yourself, or be extremely careful when eating out.  Japan would be especially challenging, since they serve a lot of seafood, including shellfish.\n\nI don't think that you have to leave - I just think that you have to shop for yourself, not eat in restaurants.  BTW, get new epipens, and liquid benadryl, too.",
      "Ah when I lived in Tokyo I had a friend who was allergic to seafood. Third day there and they went to the hospital because of a burger they ate - dashi is used in more foods than you can count. It doesn\u2019t really help your situation much, but just know you aren\u2019t the first person it has happened to and certainly won\u2019t be the last. Hang in there!",
      "Hey! I just want to say that it is SO awesome that you are on the mend and doing better than the night of your allergic reaction. It certainly sounds like it could have ended differently. You were prepared with your EpiPen and it's fortunate you were able to get some help, even if it wasn't as prompt as it should have been. They were probably a bit confused as well with the language barrier, and it makes it challenging for them to make decisions for treatment when you ARE coherent and able to consent, but the conversation and comprehension is difficult on both sides. The situation seems incredibly traumatic just by default and I'm so sorry you had to go through that.\n\nIf I were you, I'd probably go home, unless you can come up with a plan that would help ensure this doesn't happen again. Options: You can seek out vegan food. This would certainly reduce the risk assuming everything is labeled as it should be. I'd recommend finding someone who can explain your situation in Japanese and recording it to play for restaurant or grocery employees when ordering. Something along the lines of \"Hi, my name is ______, I have a deadly/severe fish and shellfish allergy. I am allergic to all fish, fish products/sauce, crustaceans, etc. (List out specifics - as you know, many people without allergies don't think about checking labels on things like sauces). Please ensure that I am not purchasing any items/dishes that contain these items. Please kindly change gloves or wash hands before preparing my dish to prevent cross-contamination. Thank you very much.\"\n\nYou can also have someone write it in Japanese and make a few copies so you have a visual you can provide as well.\n\nI would definitely use translation apps for speaking if you can to better communicate with people. Pay for the best app if you have to - it sounds like it would be worth it. Also install a translation reader app that helps you read labels. Perhaps packaged food would be safer?\n\nAt the hospital, maybe ask for simple rice, or oatmeal, anything plain... It's temporary, so you'll be okay with lower nutritional quality for a few days. \nBest of luck to you and whatever you decide to do.",
      "I used to live in Japan! Good news: Japan is soooooo clean so you don\u2019t have to worry about any kind of cross contamination. \n\nThe one thing I thought about the healthcare system there is that they are very careful about everything - and I would see people follow every single step or method which means things can take longer than you expect. Also, whatever you do, don\u2019t tell them you have the flu or Covid - once I said i thought I might have the flu and my manager at my job freaked out, made me wear a mask and stay home. (This was pre-COVID) I really had some kind of 48 hour bug but used the term flu. \n\nThere are little to no HIPAA laws there with regards to your workplace. Once my manager called the doctor to get my diagnosis to confirm I had a sinus infection and the doctor gave her the details. Not sure if this transfers outside of the work place though. \n\nYou\u2019re in Tokyo? I think Roppongi used to be where a lot of foreigners lived. (I visited Tokyo when I lived in Kobe.) you might search something like translation service and add Roppongi to the end of the search term and see what pops up.  There also might be a foreigner\u2019s center  in Tokyo - somewhere that someone may speak English and could help you get an idea of what\u2019s going on. I did find that when I was in Japan people were very kind and offered help when I needed it. As a last ditch effort you could call an English school and see if any of the teachers would be willing to help. Amity is an English school and so is Aeon (although Aeon is also a shopping store so hopefully you can distinguish the 2 somehow.) I found so much solidarity in the Expat community in Japan - all of us would help each other whether we knew each other or not. \n\nYou can also call your country\u2019s embassy in Japan, even if you\u2019re not in the same location. Maybe someone there could help. Completely unrelated: my friend got arrested in London because she had pepper spray in her luggage - it\u2019s considered a fire arm there. I called the embassy and they reassured me that she wouldn\u2019t actually go to jail and that there would just be a bunch of paperwork. She was released a couple of hours later. \n\nThere are subs on Reddit where you can ask ppl to translate things. You can go on there and ask someone to write something in Japanese and then you can show it to the doctor. Google translate doesn\u2019t always work well - I used it when I lived there but usually it did me no good. Also, sometimes I found that people could read English there but couldn\u2019t understand it when I spoke - so you might try writing things down and showing the ppl in the hospital. \n\nOrdering food: they use a ton of sea food. I\u2019d stay away from all soups if possible. Miso is normal for the morning but maybe ask for rice instead. If you look at a menu and it has pictures stick with chicken. I can\u2019t remember exactly how menus were laid out but I could usually find a pic. As un-fun as it is you could also go to McDonalds and Starbucks because many of their dishes are the same all over the world - and they have photo menus. \n\nBest of luck! Keep us updated! And don\u2019t cut your trip short! Find a cheap-ish hotel/hostel/homestay nearby and just lay low for a couple of days. Once you shake the fact that you just spent a bunch of time in a Japanese hospital you\u2019ll get your confidence back and just be more careful of what you eat! \ud83d\ude00",
      "Why on earth would you go to Japan if seafood would kill you?  I just think that\u2019s idiotic",
      "That sounds scary. The good news is that you are going to be ok.\n\nJapan has exceptional medical care. And medical staff are professionals and won't give you lesser care because you are tattooed or a foreigner.\n\nThe reason they didn't give you another epipen injection in the ambulance is likely because despite your fear and the spinning, you were stable and the job of an ambulance isn't to make you feel better, it's to get you to a hospital alive. As long as your vitals are stable, they aren't going to do anything that might monkey with that, especially with the language barrier.\n\nMoving forward, be more careful with food (especially in a fish-heavy culture, as somebody else mentioned). And find somebody to help you make yourself a card that explains your allergy in Japanese and what bystanders/ responders should do if you have a reaction. Have a plan in case something like this happens again.\n\nYou are going to be ok. And this will be something you learn from and a story you will someday tell about your adventures.",
      "Why on earth would you go to a seafood heavy, not English speaking country with a severe allergy and expect to be safe. Not everywhere is for everyone. Like come on. Are you American where you\u2019re use to people bending over backwards for every allergy? The rest of the world doesn\u2019t work like that it. It\u2019s your own personal responsibility you shouldn\u2019t trust anyone else with your health. Lesson learned I guess.",
      "Ask chat GPT to write for you in Japanese \"I am deathly allergic to seafood\" for the rest of your trip at least and communicate it with your servers. At least this.",
      "What hotel are you staying at? Most international branded hotels (Marriotts, Westin, Hyatt, Hilton, etc) have English speaking staff. My nephew recently broke his ankle and we had no issues from getting him a wheelchair, to the hospital, to getting taken care of, to getting medication, discharge. And the hotel even transported him back to the hotel. I\u2019ve not had issues with getting help despite not speaking Japanese in the 10+ trips I\u2019ve been to Japan. \n\nAlso there are loads of non seafood options that steer clear of seafood bases. Chicken and pork and beef and carb options are abound. \n\nThis is not as much towards the OP but a lot of you sound overly alarmist and ignorant of Japan and the way they do things. They are incredibly responsive and compassionate people and culture. They\u2019re more likely just overly worried about doing something to harm you when they\u2019re not feeling equipped due to the language barrier with the specific people you interacted with. I have foreign friends and relatives that have lived in Tokyo and Yokohama for over 20 years and they don\u2019t experience what so many are freaking out about and sensationalizing.",
      "Heeey quinton, sheesh that sucks, dang, must have been scary!   It's ok, breathe, relax.  You can work this out, you can do this.  In fact, you did it already - got yourself help, what a legend!  \n\n  Encountered health crisis abroad?   Yeah I (Aussie) was also hospitalised in Tokyo, years ago - was having a whole-body-skin allergic-like reaction - BAD - just about my whole body came up in huge like almost sores all over it, I thought I\u2019d caught leprosy or something from India.  I\u2019d seen doctors a few times they couldn\u2019t diagnose it the sores were just getting bigger so I ended up in hospital, close to nervous breakdown from stress.  It was just a kind of  dermatitis, they were shocked it had gotten to that point  (thanks to a shitty incompetent foreign scammer doctor) just had to put creme on it & wrap me like a mummy so they admitted me for a few days. \n\n **This was back in the very early 2000\u2019s, so no mobile phones no google translate no wifi.  I had to sneak out between lunch & dinner & get a taxi to a nearby internet cafe so I could make international call to mum** and send some freak-out emails to friends, lol.  My issue - and yours i reckon - at least I then knew what it was, and would come good after treatment and I could go on my way - which I did.  Didn\u2019t need operations or complicated further diagnostics or treatment yeey.  I suppose they\u2019re keeping you 2 nights cos duty of care - in case of some further delayed reaction?    You're feeling better now, right?   My Tokyo hospital experience - the food was drab, some of the nurses were almost surly, the doctors were curt and their bedside manners sucked  - just overworked I suppose.  \n\nSo, when you found the recent diagnosis, didn\u2019t you google-search and print out one of those bi-lingual \u201cI\u2019M FATALLY ALLERGIC TO XYZ FOOD\u201d  cards for you to carry & show everyone everywhere?  I suppose you\u2019re hypersensitive now paranoid that anything might have shellfish - lots of Japanese foods contain fish, but not particularly shellfish.   Idk, if you feel to bail then go - but there\u2019s PLENTY of foods in Japan that don\u2019t contain shellfish.  I hope you either have more or can get hold of more epipens there, just in case?   I know it\u2019s a nightmare now, but wow in a few years - or even months, weeks - you are gonna look back on this and laugh what a shit-show - it\u2019s almost like in a Tarantino movie or something.   Have you checked in with r/traveljapan, r/Tokyo , etc some communities, see if folk there have any tips or help?  I feel ya quinton, sheesh what a frikkin experience!

You could have died. Learn from this. \n\nGodspeed.",
      "I thought everyone in Japan studied English. Shellfish allergy could be a problem Miso soup is made with a fish stock, not sure if it involves shellfish. The Monasteries are vegetarian as far as I know. I would stop at a local tourist bureau and ask for guidance. Hotels could help you find places to eat that will understand food allergies. The problem might be cost. Another idea is to go to a Grocery store & pick up food there.",
      "Oof, that sounds scary, sorry you had to go through that alone. As for leaving I would just eat only at vegan restaurants or prepackaged food to be safe, and carry at least 1-2 epipens with me. Maybe limiting, but less limiting than going back home early for something that already happened! The best thing you can do right now is make sure it doesn't ruin your whole trip! You deserve to enjoy it.",
      "I have a shellfish allergy (as per an allergy test) but I\u2019m vegetarian so I avoid sushi all together.  I know you\u2019re scared but don\u2019t cut your trip short, Japan is a wonderful place.  \n\nGoogle translate app helped a lot to communicate I only ate vegetarian food.  If you can, stay away from the fish and soups, find some fast food places.  We had Indian food in Harajuku.  You got this!",
      "I'm so so sorry, friend. That's terrifying.\nIf you continue your stay, I would advise you to only eat at vegan restaurants. I have a severe gluten allergy and ate mostly at vegan places when I visited Japan. \nThis is because the vegan market is mostly foreigners so the staff usually can speak English and are far more allergy aware. Also, the food was phenomenal. You won't miss anything.\n\nPs. There are a few Facebook groups for eating vegan or allergy aware in japan you might want to check out. Please be careful if things contain \"dashi\". It's a stock that can have fish\n\nSending love and healing. Stay safe <3",
      "If there's not an actual need to leave, then don't go. There's tons of amazing food that doesn't come from the sea (I only had sushi once in a month long trip). Skip the 7/11 or Lawson's and go to CoCo House for some Katsu, I love Gyoza (really any type of dumpling), and if you like eggs there's omurice (go to Kichi Kichi Omurice in Kyoto). Also there's plenty of places to get a good pizza, and even Mexican food (had it a couple times in Japan). Remember just because you're in Japan doesn't mean you have to limit yourself to just Japanese food (it'd be like limiting yourself to just \"American\" food in the states.",

The horror, everything was old, disappointing and no entertainment. I was bored out of my ass, and with the most advanced thing being a creditcard reader in my armrest. \n\nIt was more expensive as well.",
      "I'm not large, but I am tall. 6'2\" to be exact. And unlike weight, there's nothing at all that I can do about my height.  \n\n\nI do a few things to alleviate the suffering as best I can on board. I get up and walk a bit. I wear compression stockings. I wear noise-canceling headphones, which helps with the constant drone of jet engines. I make sure to stay hydrated. I bring some snacks, perhaps even a full meal, so that I'm not stuck with the usually sub-par onboard food. (And on budget airlines, I don't pay extra for their food service, making meals a necessity.)  \n\n\nI try to get a window seat for long flights so I can lean against the wall to sleep. For shorter flights, I generally opt for an aisle seat. I try to avoid being right by the lavatories. I ask to sit in an emergency exit row if possible; however, my success rate on this has gone from 80% in the 1990s to less than 5% nowadays. Airlines figured out that they can sell access to these seats, I guess.  \n\n\nBut the biggest thing I've done is to cut way back on flying. I obviously can't swim across the ocean, but If I'm traveling inside of North America, I just go by car whenever practical. And I have a pretty lenient definition of practical. I'd rather spend two days in the car than half a day in an airplane. I mean that literally. I recently drove from Florida to New Mexico and back.  \n\n\nIn my car, I get the best seat. I get the best view. I have leg room. I can stop whenever I want. I have an unlimited selection of \"in-flight food service\". There are no baggage limits to worry about.

There's nothing good about air travel other than the ability to get somewhere faster (relative to other modes....and that isn't even always true!). When I  have a long flight/series of flights I basically deal with it by just exhausting myself so I sleep the whole way. My strategy:  \n\n\n1. The three days leading up, I start extra hydrating but also slightly sleep depriving myself. My goal is to be tired so I just zonk out on the plane.\n2. The morning of, I down a ton of water and go to the bathroom like 6 times in the airport before my flight. I stop drinking an hour before boarding. I just sip water if I need it while flying. Goal is to not wake up from needing to pee!\n3. I only eat my own food. Airport and plane food is never healthy and often sketchy. I bring my own food so there is no chance of stomach upset from eating something weird. \n4. I always book seats that give me more legroom and a window to lean on so I can sleep.\n5. Before the flight and during layovers, I spend a ton of time stretching so that I am as loose as can be and prepared for sleeping slightly uncomfortably.\n6. Now it's drug time! lol. I always take some melatonin and an advil pm when boarding starts. I sit down and throw an eye mask on, load up the familiar shows I downloaded, get comfy, and go to sleep.  \n\n\nA 6-8 hour flight, I will sleep right through basically. Longer than that, I usually wake up and will get up and do some stretches if there's a spot, sip a little water, have a little snack, go pee...then fall asleep again!",

Her blood sugar will spike into the 400s and then crash into the low 50s (anyone who knows what I'm talking about will understand that that type of dramatic swing is very very bad for the body) and it's a struggle for her to maintain any sort of normalcy due to the travel food provided, lack of water, adrenaline from the stress of airline travel, dealing with unfamiliar things, travel anxiety, etc. I felt really bad for her any time we had to do an extensive day of travel, because she was absolutely wrecked by the time we would check in to where we were staying, and basically need to just take the rest of the day off and stay inside and rest.",
      "KLM does indeed have good food. Am always glad when I get them, as my Delta codeshare flight carrier whenever I fly to EU..",
      "i bring some nice food like a chipotle bowl or some pizza, bring 2 huge jugs of water, and a book or two, carry it all in  a tote bag. i also try to do tasks ive been putting off for a while like writing a travel journal if on the way back, or just write some analysis for woork or for fun",
      "I love KLM and their food!",
      "I have suffered 10+ hour flights. I am considering Less trips to afford first class so I can sleep on the plane. I don't care about food or any other comfort. I just want to be able to sleep as much as possible. Otherwise it is neck pillow, earplugs, and eye mask which all help a little. Also, I drink lots of water before the flight which causes me to get up and walk to the restroom during the flight. This helps with my legs swelling and back pain."

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019ve been wanting to visit Japan for some time but have some problems on the food. I have severe food allergies to fish and seeing as that\u2019s a big part of the local cuisine I\u2019m a little concerned on what I\u2019d be eating. I actually went through the airport on a trip to the phillipines years ago and noticed that there was hardly any English either (at least in the airport). I\u2019m also pretty vanilla with my food tastes and definitely prefer Western food\u2026.\n\nAnyone dealt with food allergies and language barriers in Japan?",

      "Download Happy Cow. Mainly for vegan food but also generally places that can cater to allergies as well.",
      "I\u2019m also allergic to seafood and had no issue in Japan. Japanese curry, ramen, fried chicken, gyoza, a lot of the food at 7-11, western restaurants and food chains. \nI had a laminated card stating the allergy with me but never actually used it (although my allergy isn\u2019t life or death).",
      "In addition to the other tips- Try looking for places that serve Buddhist style vegetarian food, that\u2019s likely to be safe.\n\nBut there are definitely Western style restaurants available in a lot of places as well",
      "There's enough non-fish/seafood options and plenty of Western places, at least in the major urban areas",
      "There is a site called equal eats where you can get triple translated allergy cards! I have an anaphylactic peanut allergy and was terrified for my first solo travel, but they were such an amazing help. I had gotten three different languages and they all worked like a charm!\nTravelling with allergies can be so frightening, but there are so so many resources out there to help.\n\nFor the food allergy though, I wouldn\u2019t be eating dishes with meat or soups based on my own comfort with my severe allergy. When I think of travelling to SE Asia and how easy it\u2019d be to have a reaction, I always remind myself that worst case scenario I\u2019ll go to the grocery store or live off of market fruit idk\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Missing out in culinary culture is SOOOOOOO heartbreaking for me every time, but safety is priceless!\n\nBest of luck!!!",
      "If you like Italian food, there are a ton of little Italian restaurants! Curry, tempura, some sushi options, omurice, fluffy pancakes, etc. I think you'd still have a lot of options but you'd have to be more proactive in checking menus. We've only visited Tokyo so far but there was plenty of English. It helps to learn a little Japanese but English is available (menus) in many restaurants and all the train station signs have English.",
      "Hi, I'm vegan and went to Japan recently. In the big cities you can find a good number of decent vegan restaurants where you will be safe. Many of the vegan restaurants have western options. I also had some amazing italian food in japan. You can also find buddhist restaurants that are all animal and fish free if you want to try something more traditional but still fairly simple. Having a card written Japanese to explain your dietary needs will help if you find yourself at a non vegan establishment. However, you will have to be extra careful given your allergy.",
      "I ordered delivery, actually. Tax is included and tip is not required. At the end of a long day, I'm tired and don't want to travel to another neighborhood to get vegetarian food. By the way, there are ryokans that accommodate allergies and dietary preferences - particularly ones frequented by multinational guests (Hoshino hotels and ryokans). You need to email them to confirm.",
      "I don't eat any seafood, was totally fine in Japan. Lots of chicken and beef available! And there's actually pizza spots everywhere",
      "Japan is a first world country, as long as you ask for no sea food they will make your food with no sea food. But you should be clear about it, because some of their sauces use fish.",
      "There are printable allergy cards that could be suitable! I'd have a look at those.\n\nI am not allergic to fish, just really don't like it, and I found I had plenty of food options. Google translate in camera mode is your friend, check the ingredients on the packets.",
      "I've not been to Japan, but if it is similar to the rest of Asia, you should be fine. Unless you're going waaaay off the beaten track, there will always be western options.\n\nPlus Japan is quite rich, so I'm imagining there will be western fast food chains everywhere. And of course 7/11 is always good for food.\n\nFood is just a tiny part of travel. It would be a shame to miss out on the whole country and what it offers because of it. A few week of sticking to McDonalds, 7/11 sandwiches, and Pizzas won't hurt!",
      "While I don't have any allergies and such, I like to have some control over my food, and I don't like fish all that much. So my solution for Japan was the following:\n\n  \n\\* Try to stay at an accommodation with access to (some) cooking facilities. Plenty of those on AirBNB or Booking-dot-com. Sometimes a room in somebody's house with shared kitchen, sometimes a budget hotel or guesthouse with a shared microwave and tea kettle downstairs.\n\n\\* Figure what the good supermarkets in your area are. In Osaka, for example, \u7389\u51fa Tamade is a major chain. Gyomu **\u696d\u52d9\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc** is a nice chain with stores nationwide. There are some web pages in English discussing grocery stores in Japan (e.g.  https://goemon-jp.com/posts/06-of-the-cheapest-supermarket-chains-in-japan-8gCjE8uAEzTVYbCKe4FaAT , https://tokyocheapo.com/living/household/cheap-supermarkets-in-tokyo/ ), and once you know the chains' names, Google Maps is your friend.\n\n  \n\\* Go to a supermarket, figure what are the foods you will like and that can be eaten without cooking (e.g. various kinds of frozen mochi type cakes, chocolate, yogurt, fresh fruit or some salad vegetables) or can be easily cooked with the facilities you have. If in doubt what a particular product is, read the ingredient list (assuming you have at least this much literacy). One you know that you like a particular product, you can buy more of it on subsequent shopping trips without as much \"research\".\n\n\\* Cook some easy 5-minute dinner (e.g. a soup using noodles, tofu, mushrooms \\[they have so many kinds there!\\]; tea with fruit and sweets). At a nicer place with a real kitchen, I would often make pancakes for breakfast, for example, and had them with yogurt, fruit, and tea or fruit juice.",
      "While you may not be able to sample a lot of the local food there are PLENTY of options for food in Japan.  Then again you only say Japan. If you are going to the world's largest city Tokyo, or any of the other large cities you should have no problems at all.  In Tokyo you can get anything.\n\nedit: As others point out it also depends on the severity of said allergy, but I'm sure you've learned to adjust accordingly.",
      "Major stuff like airports and transit stations all have very good singage in english.\nGet a sim card so you can have internet while youre there and find an app that uses your phones camera to translate text. Ive seen them used and theyre not perfect, but they get the job done.\nPlaces that have english menus or have employees that can speak english are more expensive becayse they cater to western people, but youre basically paying extra for the convenience.\n\nFor food, theres plenty of really good western style food in japan.\nEuropean style bakeries and coffer shops are all over major cities and have really good stuff.\nTry the bassment levels of major japanese department stores, theres usually food courts there and they have lots of western style options since japanese people like western stuff too. Also, these big department stores have excellent customer service and should have no problem helping you in english.\nIf youre up to it, theres a food style called \"yoshoku\" wich is a combination of western style food that has been in japan long enough that its become japanified, lots of people love yoshoku since it gives them nostalgia about 'the good ole days'\nYou can always stick to major food chains from the west or from asia that have a high degree of consistency and are made for a wide audience.\n\nJapan is a super developed society so dont fret, theres ppl with all kinds of alergies there too and they get on just fine, have fun!",
      "It depends.. a lot of the food is cooked in dashi.  If you are ok with that, then you will be ok in Japan."

      "I mostly eat in cafes or buy food in supermarkets. I check cafes the rating of a cafes or restaurant, then I go to their Instagram and analyze it",
      "TL:DR: do your research, and have a priority list of food/places to try, and mark them on a map.\n\nFood is a highlight for me, so I do a ton of research and adjust accordingly. If the food is good, cheap, clean, accessible and different from my home country's (e.g., Thai cuisine) and I'm not staying for long, I'll plant to eat out as much as possible. If restaurant food is expensive, not accessible and/or more familiar/generic/simple, but groceries are good quality (e.g., Swiss food, sorry....) and I'm staying a long time, I'll plan to cook more often. \n\nI'll keep a map of priority food spots (google maps in enough usually). I'll usually go for restaurants popular among locals, markets/food streets, international fast food joints (it's fun to compare), a bar and cafe.\n\nSince I'm traveling solo, I'll watch out for my health a bit more and put potentially inconvenient/risky food near the end of the trip.\n\nI'll insist on buying snacks, usually chips or pastry. \n\nFine dining and influencer-reviewed places are usually low on my list. \n\nIf I don't speak the language, I'll have a translator app ready.",

I will usually cook super basic meals at the hostel and then budget to treat myself at least x2 a week maybe more as I get older I am turning more into a foodie. I usually skip all the sweet regional treats like gelato etc.",

Although I've haven't been to every country in the world, but here's my list:\n\n1.) Mexico City - The combination of the food, history, culture and genuinely nice people make this my number one spot.  The ability to see world class museums, then have an order of street tacos for three USD in a great neighborhood is something I never took for granted.  Another reason is it isn't a superficial city with just pretty views, it has the most character.  And highly underrated nightlife!\n\n2.) Rio de Janeiro - Views from Copacabana and Leblon make this number two for me.  Seeing the carioca lifestyle of enjoying the beach and sports, listening to Samba on the street, and views from SugarLoaf mountain made me realize how life should be enjoyed.\n\n3.) Porto, Portugal - Picturesque city with gorgeous views as you walk on the Luis I bridge.  Enjoying some port wine taking in the sunset or just walking through the tiny streets made me think it's the most beautiful city in Europe (personal opinion).\n\nHonorable mention - Istanbul, Turkey for the amount of history and significance, and also damn gorgeous.\n\nThere are many more cities in the world to visit, but these are mine so far!\n\nEdit: I did not expect this much feedback, great to see.

      "I have two different lists for this.\n\nThe first list is of places I have been to many times and are significant parts of my life. These are San Francisco, Hong Kong, and New York City. San Francisco is only 20 minutes away from me, it's where I work, and as a bay area native it's been a central place for many things in my life. Hong Kong is my favorite city in the world because I'm Cantonese, I have a lot of family there, and I lived here for four months when I studied abroad and made friends with other bay area exchange students who are some of my closest friends today. New York City is my favorite place to visit within the United States, I go there every 1-2 years for fun or for work, and there's always something new for me to do when I'm there.\n\nMy other list are favorite destinations that I have no personal connections to, basically favorite places I have gone to on vacations. Those are Tokyo, Edinburgh, and Montreal. These were the places I enjoyed the most for a variety of reasons, such as local culture and history, food, and photography opportunities (architecture, scenery, vistas, historic areas).",
      "1.  London - hundreds of years of historic prominence; museum-free days, smart ways of enabling public accessibility, multi-ethnic cuisine availability in variants of budget. Downside is cost and weather\n\n2. Tokyo - progressive processes yet conservative society.  Never experienced a bad meal in Tokyo let alone Japan.  Emphasis in presentation, appearance and aesthetics.  Downside: Language barrier, size of lodging accomodations, population\n\n3. NYC - never a dull moment, you can easily walk out of your hotel in Manhattan and stumble upon something interesting.  You can get lost in neighborhoods just exploring.  Specific foods are incomparable anywhere else; pizza, bagels, bodega/delis, kosher foods.  Downside:  Local walking speed is incrementally faster than the rest of the world",
      "1. Chengdu - Best food in the world (subjective!), great tea, great city parks including my favorite, great shopping, fun neighborhoods, all-around interesting culture, and so many extraordinary natural and natural/cultural areas not too far away.\n\n2. Rio de Janeiro - What OP said plus the food, LGBTQ culture, nature, hikes, parks, city life.  I don't know if anywhere is anywhere close to as gorgeous a natural setting for a large city.\n\n3. Genoa - Feels like going back in time with a huge foreboding old city, great street and homestyle food, bizarre city layout & transportation, beautiful sea setting, my favorite skyline I've seen.\n\n--\n\nOther faves:  Seoul, Tokyo, Guadalajara, Manaus, Seattle, Los Angeles, Missoula, Stockholm",
      "Toronto - Things to do for everyone with beautiful views and big on sports. Lake Ontario in the sunset is something else too. Plus Drake lives there so must be good, right? \n\nKuala Lumpur - Amazing culture, food and things to see. The cheap if you\u2019re from the West and we\u2019ll connected. The people there are awesome in my experience. \n\nVienna - Rich in History and amazing in the winter and summer. Amazing architecture that has managed to survive both world wars, cheap transport and good nightlife also. A few Grand Palaces worth visiting too. \n\nHonourable mentions: Antwerp for its nightlife and Ho Chi Minh City for its amazing people.",
      "1. Hanoi - loved it, so cool, lovely people, loved the buildings and the bikes and the food\n\n2. Kuala Lumpur - felt like I was in a video game, such crazy massive buildings but also felt like I was in the jungle. Great food\n\n3. Portsmouth, UK - this one is a bit rogue but I lived in Southsea, Portsmouth literally seconds from the seafront for a year and it was bliss. All the best bits of Brighton, but SO much cheaper and no tourists. Beautiful beach, independent shops, eccentric people, lovely lovely little city",
      "Cape Town, South Africa. Has a blend of culture, unique climate, and beautiful Table Mountain.\n\n Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The melting pot. Food, language, architecture, and across the board. Public transportation. Backpackers scene.\n\n Milwaukee, USA. City of the Great Lake without the crowded Chicago feel. Very art oriented. Clean. Enjoyed the local breweries and open-minded people.",

I feel like I'm in a neo-noir movie whenever I go (or maybe I'm just weird lol). On top of that, mix of old and new, East and West. Good food and hiking trails are nearby. Lots of good memories there.\n\n**London**. My first European trip was here so this was a personal highlight. So much diversity and culture here, along with the amazing museums you can go in for free! Lots to see just by walking around.\n\n**Singapore**. Hot and humid af when I got here in July 2016 but worth the endurance to check out the amazing, diverse food scene and neighbourhoods.",

Fun and beautiful but still calm and sorta small- good day trips, great food, nice people. It also has good nightlife and a good backpacker scene. it checks all the boxes- rest of Georgia is awesome too, don't just visit Tbilisi go everywhere. \n\nBatambang or Kampot Cambodia are both just pleasant, calmer than the other cities but it doesn't feel empty or out of the way (okay maybe a little with Kampot). Anywhere in SEA is a standout tho I could probably pick any mid size city on that landmass as #2 for me personally. \n\nBukhara Uzbekistan is just awesome. I can see how it might not be ideal to stay for months there, but it is such a great place to visit and has such amazing history and structures, it's also way smaller and calmer than Samarqand. It's wonderful. \n\nHonorable mentions- Yogyakarta,  Almaty and Aktau, and Tokyo despite it's size",

Met all my expectations and exceeded some of them. \n\n2) Banff/Jasper (visted both on the same trip) - Amazing nature. Went in July, but it was still a bit chilly. I loved it. Never a dull view no matter where I was and what direction I was looking at.\n\n3) Saigon - My family is from South Vietnam, but I was born in the states. I kind of have the best of both world where I am familiar with the language and food, but since I'm not from there I can still get lost and explore it.\n\nHonorable mentions: SF - close to home for me (based in the Bay Area) and it's the place where I solo travel the most due to that. Has it's problems, but also a lot to do. Honestly the Bay Area has so many things to do that I'm interested in and I can easily make a new solo itinerary on any given day.",
      "1. San Juan, PR - beach, music, culture, food galore \n2. Istanbul, Turkey - food galore, easy transportation, safe, endless things to do\n3. Porto - get lost in the city, unbeatable views, safe",
      "My top 3 would be Sydney, Bangkok and Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong was really the first major city I'd ever been to (with loads of tall buildings/skyscrapers). It was new to me, lots of nature nearby, and on the water. Lots of good food, and a few cool places to explore.\n\nSydney is just kind of an iconic city. Lots of world famous landmarks, easy to get around, and again is very nature based (on the water and loads of beaches nearby).\n\nBangkok again is just another cool place that you could explore for ages and still not see it all. Fairly affordable and mostly easy to get around (but could be better). Great food, lots of cool sights to see, and just interesting, a lot to do for all budgets, and just has a certain feeling to it.",
      "I have a thing for milder climates, so my three favourites are:\n\n1. Reykjavik, Iceland: great people, great houses, great food and music, wonderful hiking and great pools and beaches\n\n2. Hobart, Tasmania: best food, consistently everywhere, in a \u2018western country\u2019, great people, stunning scenery and fantastic hiking and cycling and climbing opportunities all around the city and it\u2019s surrounding suburbs. Great for rowing and kayaking too, just watch out for orcas under your boat at times!\n\n3. Wellington, New Zealand - just wonderful in every way. Again, the people, the views, the stunning harbour and the strait, the weather and the night life are fab.\n\nThrough writing this list I have realised that I love windy places that are small in size but close to huge natural and protected areas, surrounded by cool oceans.",
      "1) Osaka/ Kansai region (Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto are almost 1 giant city. Amazing mix of culture, food, walkability, business, good public transit, nightlife, cyberpunky or traditional Japanese vibes, more friendly and fun than tokyo imo and it feels like living in the future as envisioned in the 80's)\n\n2) NYC (I live nearby and have taken advantage of so much of the cool shit to do and food) NYC is amazing if you have the cash to drop and get some friends in the city to show you more local spots. Gotta love the gritty fuck you attitude, amazing variety of great food, incredible business/ networking opportunities, levels of service, arts scene, amazing skyline, and a generally fun and diverse city that has anything you want and need. I love NYC despite the high costs and crazy people in the streets and comparatively dirty subway.\n\n3) Bangkok (Love the chaotic and fun nature of the bustling business, cultural, and political capital of Thailand) I love the warm weather, amazing street food scene, amazing rooftop bars, incredible value for money if you have USD or Euros, friendly people, and seemed relatively safe from violent crime. Bangkok makes a great base in Southeast Asia and is such an exciting and fun city to explore. Great mix of old and new sites to visit.\n\nHonorable mentions - L.A./ So. Cal, Amsterdam, Charlotte NC, Paris, Washington DC, Taipei, Seoul, Chicago, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Charleston SC, Hanoi, Ashville NC, Hiroshima, Las Vegas, Prague, San Francisco, Montreal, Boston, Ithaca, Quebec City, Edinburgh, Berlin, Miami, Vienna, Traverse city MI, Hualien \n\nSo  many interesting and cool cities so little time or money!",
      "1. **Berlin**: unbeatable mix between old and new, endless green space, liberal-minded people, incredible nightlife, hundreds of museums and fascinating history. Ugly on the surface, but beautiful once you get to know it (lived here for a year).\n2. **Sarajevo**: such a magical city and blend between Austro-Hungarian/Ottoman history and architecture, amazing food, beautiful mountains and sunset spots, tragic but fascinating recent history, and wandering the streets at night with the call to pray and church bells ringing simultaneously. \n3. Bangkok: best SE Asian city hands down. Food, chaos, so many things to do, beautiful people, amazing shopping, and more grit than places like Singapore or KL.\n\nI expect **Mexico City** will top this list after my trip in July though.  \n\n\nHM: Doesn't really count as a 'city', but **Lamu Town** is the best place I have been in my life. A place that truly sweeps you away 400 hundred years. No cars, only donkeys, the kindest people, stunning architecture and beautiful beaches/waterfront setting. Would go back again and again in a heart beat. If you have heard of it, Google it.",
      "1. Rome - stunning in every sense of the word and has everything you could want from a city.\n\n2. Barcelona - nightlife, food, beaches, weather. Yes please.\n\n3. Hoi An, Vietnam - magical place, truly felt like a different world and the light boats on the water is such a vivid memory of mine",
      "Singapore for the food, the weather, the mix of old and new.\nParis for the food, the architecture, the shopping, the museums, sitting at a cafe just watching the world go by, and the food.  Did I mention the food?\nVancouver for the natural beauty, the feel that you\u2019re in a mini-NYC, the markets, and because I\u2019ll never forget my first time there in the summer, 80 something degrees and look towards the mountains and they\u2019re still snow-capped.",
      "My three:\n\n- Mexico City, the food, architecture, history, diversity, organised chaos.\n \n- Krakow, food, history, walkability, laid back vibe\n\n- Sarajevo, love the whole East meets West vibe, amazing food, vibrant social scene and history.",
      "1. Barcelona - beautiful architecture, amazing nightlife, beaches, and delicious food! You feel on tapa the world! \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udf0a\u26bd\n\n2. Seoul - one of the most high tech and modern cities with great public transportation. Delicious Korean BBQ, markets, shopping, and Koreans know how to party! People who call NYC the city that never sleeps have never been to Seoul lol. You can party at bars or clubs until the sunrises, and then head to a restaurant to get Haejonguk (hangover soup) \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\udf56\ud83d\udd7a\n\n3. Taipei - modern city, beautiful architecture, nice mountain views, amazing night markets and street food, and some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet! Make sure you try Taiwanese beef noodle soup! \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddfc\ud83c\udf5c\u26f0\ufe0f",
      "Venice - Without a doubt the most beautiful city in the world\n\nMarrakech - Very unique (also considering it's the only city outside of EU and NA I visited), beautiful architecture/history, good food and a very nice atmosphere \n\nEdinburgh - Incredible architecture and history and beautiful surrounding nature, the only negative is the weather.\n\nHonorable mentions: New York, Lisbon, Madrid Chefchaouen and Porto. Loved all of them as well, but they were slightly less memorable to me.",
      "Cordoba, Spain \u2014 smaller city with such rich history, amazing food, and not as crowded as other Spanish cities\n\nAmsterdam, Netherlands \u2014 historic, picturesque, and walkable; every block is like a postcard\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, USA \u2014 the people, the music, the bayou\n\nBoston, Massachusetts, USA \u2014 went to college near Boston and never really appreciated it until I went back as an adult, 10+ years later. It's so walkable and has such fascinating history.",
      "Istanbul for sure. Haven\u2019t been there recently but I lived there in the late 90\u2019s. Good public transport. Amazing food. Obviously the history. Southern and centralish Turkey are must sees if you can. I had a FWB who worked in the Bazaar. They took me to a lot of non touristy places that I wouldn\u2019t recommend unless you go with a known local. 10/10 recommend.\nLamu, Kenya. Not a huge city at all. It\u2019s on a tiny island off the coast in the Indian Ocean. No vehicles. Gotta get there by boat. Stayed in guest houses. Food was amazing, especially if you like seafood. BRING YOUR SUNSCREEN. 9/10 because I hated the little airplane that I had to take from Nairobi. Vomit inducing. \nGlen Coe, Scotland. More of an area really. Perfect for hiking, history and whisky. Did a car rental with a sat nav and it was fine. Super friendly people. Great place to reconnect with yourself. 10/10",
      "1. *Tel Aviv, Israel* - I'm totally biased because I live here, but absolutely amazing city. You have Jaffa that is very very old and beautiful and then you have Tel Aviv proper which is very modern. The best beaches, I have never been to a place with better beaches. Great places to go out, I've been to cities where all restaurants close by 20:00, here places close at 22:00 at the earliest, but most places are even later, and then the bars and clubs are open until morning. Not to mention the food is great, especially if you're vegan or vegetarian, so many options. (Also, gay culture is very strong, so many gay bars and clubs, the pride parade is huge, the biggest in the middle east)\n\n\n2. *Singapore, Singapore* - very cool city with great culture. I loved the east meets west vibe of everything. Very English but also very asian, which is a fusion I hadn't ever experienced before. Great food with many different cuisines all done very well. I loved the amount of great museums, and the gorgeous architecture. I can't wait to be in the area again so I can go back\n\n\n\n3. *London, England* - I am very much a museum girly and London has so many beautiful museums. Also, of course, the history. There's just so much to do and experience. Also, so much theater and culture to experience. Not to mention, everything is super easy to get to because of the amazing public transport.",
      "Tokyo - Loved the crazy amount of variety you can find in the city, literally a million things to see and do and each district has its own vibe.  The dark and rainy nights in Golden Gai were just so fun.\n\nPrague - I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the architecture was so striking and walking around the city at night made me feel like I was somewhere else.\n\nSingapore - I loved the ethnic and cultural diversity in the city, there was a lot of great food to be had and it was just really enjoyable to walk around.",
      "1. Trinidad Cuba beautiful colonial style city with amazing beaches, people and music\n\n2. New Orleans was there fir mardi gras and was amazed with how friendly the people were there.\n\n3.Perugia Italy was only supposed to spend one night here on a journey through Italy ended up spending two days here and sacked off Florence for it and was well worth it, one of the most beautiful city's I have ever seen. The city is still walled and the city centre is entirely medieval buildings on top of a hill giving 360 degree views if the surrounding countryside and sunsets. Amazing food as well.",
      "Tough question and I'll probably change my mind immediately after posting but here we go.\n\n**Belgrade, Serbia** \u2013 My grandparents were Yugoslav so there is a lot of nostalgia there for me. But regardless, it will blow away any preconceptions you had about the place. The people, history, food, coffee culture and nightlife. It has it all.\n\n**Tokyo, Japan** \u2013 There is nowhere else like it. Stubbornly traditional yet incredibly progressive, it is the future and the past at the same time. It's huge, quirky and every neighbourhood is distinctly different.\n\n**Granada/Sevilla, Spain** \u2013 I can't decide which I like more but they are kind of similar in many ways anyway. Beautiful, incredible food, friendly people and the perfect lifestyle.\n\nMedell\u00edn just missed out. Common theme and the greatest asset a city can have: its people.",
      "In no order mine are:\n\nMarseille, France: So much history and the vibe of the city is so different than the rest of France.\n\nSapporo, Japan: The Sapporo Snow Festival was at the top of my bucket list for a long time but I also fell in love with the city itself. The best food in Japan and so much to explore just outside the city.\n\nSan Diego: My favorite city in the US. The food is top notch and the blend of cultures in the city is fascinating.\n\nHonorable mentions to: Geneva, Grenoble, and Takamatsu.",
      "What about Florence? Have you been there? Full of history, art, amazing views and the food is something special!",
      "In my opinion the countryside and small towns are always better than the large cities. \n\nBut that doesn't mean there aren't some amazing large cities.\n\nMy choices (in no particular order):\n\n1.  Hong Kong:  The hectic atmosphere.  The history.  The dramatic mountains behind the exciting skyline.  The port teaming with boats of all shapes and sizes.  The feeling of it being the meeting point of empires.\n\n2.  La Paz: The dramatic view as you enter the city from El Alto.  The food.  The architecture.  The constant festivals.\n\n3.  Budapest:  The history, architecture, food, and hot springs.\n\n4.  Istanbul:  Ancient impressive architecture, vibrant atmosphere, great food, and the Bosporus is almost as impressive as the Hong Kong harbor.\n\nHonorable mention:  London- It has amazing monumental architecture and great museums.  But unlike the four listed above it has no natural beauty and it doesn't have the exciting, vibrant feel of the other places.",
      "I can only name 2 for sure. \n\nTokyo. What can I say? Biggest city in the world, like 15 or so Manhattans connected by the best subway system IMO on the planet. Clean, safe, and according to Bourdain, the best food city. Tons of public restrooms, great people watching, I've been there twice now for almost 8 weeks combined, and I feel like I've experienced about .005% of it. \n\nBangkok. Like a different planet. Friendlier, sillier people than Tokyo. Chaos. Motorbikes. More scammers looking for tourists, including their taxi drivers, but still safe. \n\n3rd? Not sure. Shanghai, Taipei, Hong Kong, Seoul, Paris, Osaka, etc... they were all awesome. I love the city I live in, LA. Best thing about ending a trip is I am excited to come back to LA, grab a burrito.",
      "Someone else mentioned that there should be 2 categories: cities you\u2019ve only visited and cities you\u2019ve spent a lot of time in. I was kinda thinking along the same lines\u2026\n\nCities I\u2019ve visited:\n\n1. Paris: I felt like a different person in Paris. I thought different thoughts. There was something genuinely magic about it. I loved the nightlife and strange liquors I\u2019d never had before. I loved the museums, gardens, beautiful girls. I\u2019m not crazy about French food, but whatever\u2026\n\n2. Hong Kong (pre-CCP): HK is simply stunning. The view from the top of the mountain is incredible. The way the city is layered on uneven terrain is very unique. We had the best dim sum, tea, HK waffles, roasted duck, wontons, etc\u2026 There was also random stuff like a hot dog+wine bar.\n\n3. Madrid: I also loved Barcelona, but Madrid was more convenient for a short visit. Of course there are some of the best museums in the world. I got to see my boi, Goya. The nightlife is pretty insane, with random drunk reveling at all hours, every night. \n\n\nCities I\u2019ve spent time in:\n\n1. Hangzhou, China: Another one of those magic cities where I just feel different. It\u2019s a big modern city, but also a sort of bamboo tea paradise with pagodas, villages, strangely shaped mountains.\n\n2. Los Angeles: I\u2019m a Gemini and it has everything. Sea, mountains, desert. Nearly every type of culture, food, art, etc. Some might say it has \u201ceverything and nothing,\u201d but it has a soul too.\n\n3. Shenyang, China: This is where is all happens. This is where you fall in love, get stabbed, eat dogs, and fear the Chinese police. It\u2019s not really a good place. The BBQ is good and underrated. It\u2019s an open secret that there\u2019s opium in some of the food. It\u2019s a random place, a place where Chinese people act ghetto. I was there. Stuff happened. I don\u2019t know why."

    "selftext": "Hello! In March next year I\u2019m going to have 5 days in which I would like to do a 5 day solo trip to either Berlin or Budapest.\n\nI would like to experience a city with lots of fun! Lots of nightlife and partying, but also great history, food and sightseeing.\n\nFrom the outside looking in - it appears Berlin has amazing history and culture. Also it\u2019s renowned for its techno scene - however I\u2019ve heard the clubs are very exclusive. Which is a worry for me, since being rejected entry for not wearing the right clothing or not be \u201cright enough\u201d doesn\u2019t seem \u201cfun\u201d to me.\n\nBudapest also seems like a really cool city - lots of party hostels and interesting architecture and history. But I do have a little fear that I may get bored after 5 days. And it is about half the size of Berlin, so perhaps it\u2019s not as \u201clively\u201d.\n\nBased on my preferences, which city would you recommend me to go to most - Berlin or Budapest?\n\nThank you!",
    "subreddit": "solotravel",
    "comments": [
      "Budapest hands down imo. The nightlife is great in Berlin but idk it feels like you\u2019re supposed to be ashamed of being a tourist.\nBudapest was super friendly, much cheaper, much better food (to my tastes) and still plenty to do. The architecture was way more interesting and beautiful to me.\n\nYou\u2019ll have an amazing time either way, Budapest just appealed to my tastes a lot more.",
      "You honestly can't go wrong with either. Both offer much of what you're after. If you stay at a party hostel in Budapest a lot of the events can be booked directly through them. I will say that Budapest for some reason seems to attract some pretty obnoxious party animal types that you might get sick of. From the hostel staff themselves to people also staying in them, some just take it too far and shame you for wanting a quiet one. Overall I prefer Berlin because I think it has more to offer. I also think clubbing there people are more respectful of your personal space etc. Budapest definitely has its fair share of sex pests groping on the dance floors which can be a pretty big turn off. Berlin really does feel like a melting pot so the food scene there is honestly pretty great and diverse and I'd give them the edge. When it comes to history Budapest has the grandeur of it's beautiful architecture and is pretty picturesque in that regard. Berlin however despite so much of it being decimated during WW2 and later rebuilt has such a unique vibe from a historical perspective. I guess from so much happening in Berlin during the 20th century makes it easier to connect with and understand the history a bit better. Overall I'd say Berlin is the winner but everyone's taste is different and I'm sure you'll have a blast either way.",
      "Depends on your music tastes. If you LOVE the boom boom music, Berlin. If you don\u2019t love the dungeon house, I had a 1000x better experience in Budapest. And the food is light years better",
      "I\u2019ve been back and forth between the two a couple times. Berlin has about double the population of Budapest, so it feels more vibrant. But both are lively cities - and I wouldn\u2019t understand why you would want to limit yourself to 5 days in either city. Especially since you\u2019re going solo. If you like big cities with lots of things going on, Berlin is definitely better than Budapest - but if you like putting time into exploring beautiful smaller towns, then Budapest is better than Berlin. Budapest also has much better food than Berlin.\r  \n\r  \nIn my opinion, if you want to see a great city with really incredible architecture, get a hop on a train to Vilnius. It\u2019s smaller, but has more amazing buildings than either Budapest or Berlin.\r  \n\r  \nIf you like history and culture, then Budapest is tops. There\u2019s an incredible museum in the old part of town called the House of Terror - it really puts Berlin\u2019s Holocaust museums to shame. There are also lots of museums devoted to Hungarian history and culture, so I can definitely understand why someone would find them more interesting than Berlin.\r  \n\r  \nNightlife in Budapest is definitely less expensive, but I saw no lack of things for solo travelers to do at night. You can still find plenty of clubs to get into, and the guys are nice and easy going - so if you like dancing, Budapest is a good bet. Also, there are plenty of cool cafes where you can go meet people.\r  \n\r  \nBerlin has no shortage of parties for solo travelers - it\u2019s a definite must if you like partying or techno music. So don\u2019t worry about that part.\r  \n\r  \nYou\u2019re right that Budapest is smaller, but I don\u2019t think you should let that be a deciding factor.\r  \n\r  \nIn short - I could easily live in either city. Both have tons of character, both have plenty of things to do and see - so I would just base my preference on other factors. What\u2019s your favorite genre of music? Are you into the arts? Do you like modern art? Then Berlin would be better for you. Do you like history and culture? Then go with Budapest. Are you interested in going to clubs or raves? Go with Budapest (and if not, both cities will have plenty to do)."

Chilled, relaxed, fun. But then she got really prickly. It was clear that our pace of travel was very different. I was up and ready to go by about 8.30, wanting to beat the hottest time of the day. I do heaps of walking, averaging at least 10+ kms a day (which is a lot, but I know plenty of people do more). I do  research about each place so I have a vague idea of things I want to see or areas to explore. For meals I would typically have a simple breakfast that I make myself, lunch would vary and often be something quick and on the go. Dinner I like a mix of eating out, take out or a supermarket meal I'll put together. I love trying local food.\n\nMy friend on the other hand, was a late riser, would prefer to spend nights in our shared accommodation watching netflix, rarely wanted to eat out and wasn't really well researched so it was always me coming up with ideas. \n\nWe managed our shared cost on the app Split Wise. I found she often wasn't very forthcoming in paying for her fair share, so by the end she owed me a bit of money. \n\nWe never had a fight but she got so grumpy with me. She didn't seem to want to walk anywhere. She was really moody all the time, often just going in her room at night and not saying anything. One day in the middle of our holiday I said I needed a solo day and we'd catch up that night. I wanted to do a bit of walking and knew she wouldn't be up for it, plus by then we'd spent 7 days together so I needed a break. This was something we'd discussed at home so I didn't see an issue.\n\nAfter that she went from *sometimes* wanting to do things to *never* wanting to do things. On our last night together I suggested we go out for dinner, she said no, she needed to pack for her flights the next day. So I go out solo and when I get back she's in her pj's by 8 and watching netflix. \n\nIt's been 2 weeks and we usually chat all the time (pretty much daily) and I haven't heard from her once. I contacted her a week ago and she was pleasant enough but nothing since then. \n\nI'm sure there were things about me that grated her, but not enough to end a friendship. We both love travel and are in a similar position financially and I was really hoping we could do more trips togehter, but after this experience I'm not even sure our friendship will survive. ",

      "I\u2019ve learned that I am happy as a solo traveller who occasionally meets up with a stranger or other fellow solo traveller but as mentioned in the other posts, everyone has different travel styles and I value the freedom.  I have lost friendships and relationships with family from just traveling together.  Some expected me to plan everything and others just wanted to lay by a pool or coffee shop 24:7 and some are most definitely bougie foods of which I am not LOL \n\nIt\u2019s funny because I spent majority of my life wishing I had people to travel with and was depressed because I was missing out.

      "A few years ago a group of five ladies traveled to a beach town with several local historical sites. Unbeknownst to me, the lady who took control of the group booked everyone for a day at a water slide park (!). These were 60+ year old single women. WTH?? I felt nostalgic about spending days at the beach with a few side jaunts into local history. However, the leader of the pack absolutely did not want to go to the beach at all! Not even once!! Why even go to a beachside resort, then?? We did only what we let the leader had planned! When I stood up to her, the rest of the group just cowered and said zip. Being I have always felt a little manipulated by this leader \"friend\", but after that trip, I vowed to never go anywhere with her- and therefore the rest of the group- ever again. None of the rest of the ladies have associated with me ever since. I GET IT! I had different expectations than they did. Since I was the only one in the group who was still working, my time off was too valuable to be wasted on a completely miserable trip. Never again!",
      "I think we would be very compatible travelling. When I go somewhere I travel, when my friends or family go somewhere they have a vacation. Multiple times my group has gone out to eat, and I've joined them by buying something small, an appetiser or just a drink, and later went to a grocery store and bought a meal.\n\nI'm happy to take public transport for longer times or if my legs hurt a lot. Otherwise, I'm walking 10-15 kilometres a day. My friends, on the other hand, would prefer taking a cab for a kilometre walk.\n\nI'll budget my accommodation, my friends don't. I like to spend my money on theatres, shows, etc. Not on food and accommodation. I'm exploring every nook and cranny of a city and conversing with the locals. I'm very different from my family and friends,  but I've accepted that while I feel like none of them have. They don't see why I would prefer to spend all my money on travelling a few countries alone. They don't see why I set a small budget for food and souvenirs per day. I am crazy to them. A reason I prefer going solo for a day or two if I'm abroad with people. Or we make compromises, and I do a day like they want to, and they do a day like I want to. Your friend seems like they were not ready to give up their comfort. That's why travelling with people really shows you if you can live together. \n\nI have a friend with whom I went on a week long trip once. We grew to hate each other. Now we're okay and are actually planning a new trip, a long weekend. We both know what we want to do, and we both know what to expect from the other person. So I even offered that I'll go alone if you don't want to do that, but if you do want to, then tag along! And she said she wanted to visit a place and I said sure, I don't really like it  but does it matter? No. I want to say some people just can't travel together and some can. I also want to say that you could have perhaps even offered to spend one day with them like they wanted to, even if it meant you'd hate the day. Have them get the freedom or if you knew more places ask them what they'd like and offer a place or activity that could be pleasing to them. Your friend wasn't ready to compromise, but it sounds like you weren't either.\n\nI hope you can recover your friendship, but I'd suggest you don't travel with them again. You clearly aren't compatible.",

      "Has this friend of yours ever traveled before? What's the point of visiting a new place if all you want to do is sleep in late, eat at your AirBnB, not try new foods, and spend every evening on the couch watching Netflix? Maybe she doesn't want to be out walking all day long, but that doesn't mean you guys couldn't have taken mass transit, or an Uber, to get around to various places in the city to see sights and get a bite to eat, without walking 10km. I can understand taking a day to relax during my 10 day trip to a new city, especially if you've been really on the go and walking all over the place. I think she was totally unprepared for this trip and had the completely wrong attitude.",
      "I learned a while ago that I can't travel with just anyone. I went on an all inclusive vaca with a friend and our idea of vacation was very different. I don't like to lay on the beach for hours every single day for 7 days while she does. I like to venture outside the resort for some excursions, I like to try local foods and don't like to spent hours eating a single meal. One day, we took a shuttle to a nearby market but had to rush back shortly after just so she wouldn't miss lunch at the hotel. \ud83d\ude11  Towards the end of the week, I just left her at the dining room because I don't feel like waiting for her to finish her meal (she take over an hour to eat). \n\nNowadays, I either travel solo or only with like minded friends. Thankfully, my partner and I have similar travel style.",
      "Is this the first time that you travelled with her? What was your discussion/planning before you proceed with the trip? Did both of you communicated your travel style? Maybe it had a different outcome if you both communicated at the beginning ie that you love waking up early but if she wants to sleep in you can just meet during lunch and tour together after that. That is what/how I at least do with my friends traveling with me. I\u2019d say that I want to see this/that and if they are not up for it they are welcome to explore on their own. Her owing you money is not cool. I\u2019d be upset (since I travel with a budget) if the person I\u2019m traveling with would always rely on me paying for food/things and will just pay me later on and never pay. In that case I always say that we pay separately.",
      "I have had similar experiences traveling with a friend who loves to travel, but we just have very different styles and interests I think. \n\nMany years ago, a friend kept bugging me about taking a trip together,  and told him that I had a biz trip coming up, but since where we were going was close-by, I'd meet up with him over there. This friend is very well-traveled, and was constantly traveling to all these different places around the world. I figured it should be pretty easy to travel together.\n\nSince I could speak the local language, and had lived there previously, I lead most of the trip. Unlike OP's friend, we walked everywhere, and generally had a blast. We met up with some of my old friends, and strangely, he came along with me to meet up with old business colleagues and relatives. \n\nWe are both foodies, so we ate very well, and we both love to drink, so we drank a lot too. \n\nWhere things didn't mesh so well started with the planning of the trip. Since we weren't flying together to get there, and since we fly on the same mileage program anyway, there wasn't really any conflict on how to get there and back. For the hotel, back then, I was not really concerned about hotel points, so we first looked at a place on something similar to AirBnB. Location was pretty convenient to everything, but in the end, we couldn't get it for the time we were there. I kept suggesting different places, but he insisted on one particular hotel. I think it might have been due to the hotel offering extra points for the stay. I kept protesting that it was a long walk to the nearest train or subway station. Eventually, I just went with it, and for the most part, we ended up taking taxis way more than I would have liked.\n\nFor me, I like to make the most of my trips, and take things to the very last minute. I know that the ride back to the airport would take 1-1.5 hours, and was planning the last stretch of the trip accordingly. \n\nI noticed that things start to be different the day before we left. My friend had booked a bus ride back to the airport, but scheduled it for 11:30am, but our flight back out was at 6:00pm. I changed it to 1:30pm, but if it were me traveling solo, I'd probably set it for 3pm. \n\nOn the final day, we were up early, and were walking around in some of the shopping districts, but noticed my friend was not as chipper as the rest of the week. I asked him what was wrong, but he told me that on the day of travel, he is usually just a little more \"nervous\" about missing the flight.  Since this wasn't going to work too well, we just headed back to the hotel, and moved our luggage to the hotel where we would be taking the airport bus. We changed it to another hotel because I saved one of my favorite local restaurants as the last one to visit before leaving. \n\nOnce we were at the airport, my friend started to look alive again, and we had about 3 hours to kill. For me, I really hate spending time at the airport, but I discovered on this trip that my friend is the opposite. He needed to buy some souvenirs on the way out, and I wanted to buy a few things before heading out too, along with wanting to take a smoke before we left, so we agreed to meet at the gate around the time of boarding. When we met up again, after buying a few souvenirs, my friend was at the lounge having a drink before coming out to meet me. I also have lounge access, but always found them to be a bit of a hassle, and since they didn't have designated smoking areas, I passed this time.\n\nOverall, the trip was fine, and my friend and I still have a friendship, but it was definitely did show me that there are certain people I can travel with, and others that are a bit more difficult.",
      "Lol same thing happened to me. These days with everyone working, we all have different expectations for what a vacation is.\n\nI was in Spain and I wanted to try an expensive seafood/raw bar but my friend refused because it was too expensive. I said I would go alone after they insisted on eating somewhere cheaper so we split and agreed to meet after food, I thought it was no big deal but after I finished my meal, I looked around for my friend and found they were nowhere to be seen. The issue here is I had no cell phone service and couldn't speak Spanish so I had no idea how to find my hostel or get back, I was stranded.\n\nI finally found a taxi who gave me directions to get back to the hostel and when I got there I found my friend sleeping soundly in bed and it infuriated me to the point that I wanted to book a ticket back home right then and there but I ended up staying and finishing the trip for another 1.5 weeks but I made a mental note to myself to never put myself in that situation again.\n\nWe are still friends today because we're almost like siblings but that moment was rough..."

    "selftext": "What are a few things you think people think about solo travel that often don't ring true in reality? Interested to see what people think. I'd say...\n\n. You'll definitely meet people solo travelling and it's easy to do so - nope, you could go on a dozen, 20 or who knows how many trips and not make friends. People are different and not everyone travels to meet people or cares to, it can be harder if you don't stay in a hostel and don't want to go to a bar alone.\n\n. Solo travel is cheap - not necessarily, SE Asia? Sure. It depends on the location and your travel habits but it can be just as expensive solo as it can for 2 in places. You'd be splitting hotels, flights, food but you're taking all of those costs alone, though if you don't eat a lot it could end up cheaper solo.\n\n. Solo travel is this whimsical adventure of doing what you want and its always fun - this is a big one, people really buy into the image of solo travel sold by influencers and to be fair they do a good job of selling it. Travel isn't always fun, sometimes things go wrong, bags go missing, you get scammed, you run into assholes or dangerous individuals. You're in a foreign country alone and may not speak the language, not to scare monger but a lot can go wrong.\n\nThis is why I like the travel channels like Wolters world that keep it real and show the ups and downs of travel, it's not always perfect and it's important to manage expectations.",

      "That you have to meet amazing people who will be your lifelong friends or partner. Honestly, I don't travel to make friends and while I will go on day tours and food/beer tours at night, I like exploring on my own. Being on your own doesn't have to be lonely. You can go out to eat and sit at the bar or go at less busy times to get a solo table.\n\nAnd not everyone is going to look at you if you at alone.\n\nYou don't have to stay in hostels in order to save money. I haven't shared a room since after college and I can't stand to hear other people snore. Before hostels could save you money, but since budget motels like Premier Inn and Motel One in Europe, I can get a clean bed, TV and bathroom plus breakfast for little more than a nicer single room hostel. And hostels aren't always the swinging hangouts they were before the internet. Now many people are on their phone and have their own friends they meet up with.\n\nFinally solo traveling won't necessary help you find yourself, cure depression or take away your problems at home. I see so many people with deep depression and breakups and unemployment that think traveling solo will cure everything. As someone who tried to run away and travel to avoid issues, you are only pushing those feelings aside until you come back. And then the depression is worse because you miss your vacation.  IMO, you need to be in a good headspace to enjoy traveling solo and sometimes seeing a good therapist and getting in a better mindset would be a better use of your funds.",
      "That I meet lots of people and make connections abroad. I'm not travelling to meet people or make new friends, I'm travelling to see new things, eat the food, and be far away from home. I like being in a place where nobody knows me and I don't know anyone.",

You see a lot of history and learn a lot about the country\u00a0\n\nIt would surprise people how much many travelers have zero interest in understanding what they are experiencing\u00a0\n\nNot everything is translated to English and it can get exhausting manually translating every or do your own research which not everyone I\u2019ve meet does they make assumptions (and often tell you your wrong when you correct them)\n\nI\u2019ve also, meet so many solo travelers who just see a country. Their main goals are parting and shopping and they may go to one or two historical places because visually they look cool or are Instagramable not because they are interested learning about history. \u00a0Which again to each their own\u00a0",

      "It's probably a mixed bag. Some people who travel \"full time\" are definitely just rich haha. \n\nBut there are also some \"digital nomads\" who work remote jobs and bring in income while traveling. \n\nAnd there are, I think, some frequent solo travelers who *do* have 8-hour workdays, but in careers that allow for more frequent time off. For example I started a job recently teaching in higher education - during the school year I have a fulltime workload but I have summers off, so I'm aiming to take at least a month every summer to travel (hopefully more like two months but will see if budget allows). Similarly I met a nurse once when traveling, who sort of alternated between working for a while then taking time off to travel.\n\nThere's a reason places like Southeast Asia are popular in the subreddit too though. These are places where (other than the price of actually flying there) you can travel quite cheaply (by \"wealthy country\" standards anyway). Delicious street food meals for $0.30 to $3ish USD for instance\n\nBroadly speaking of course, anyone who can afford to fly to another continent is wealthy by global standards (not to mention all the privileges that come from having a \"good\" passport from a wealthy country).",
      "I also share an interesting view on this. Travelling in shorter more regular spans funded by a full time job doesn't make you any less of a traveller. It doesn't mean you're just touristy or ignorant or part of the rat race. \n\nBut if you work your ass off full time to fund short trips using your annual leave, where you explore, socialise and try new things, its still a massive accomplishment. And a very open minded thing to do. \nAnd let's be real..it's harder ! And more earned. I work 45 hours a week in the food industry and trust me it's hard, tiring and not well paid. But I have an interest and a growing career. I only have 3/4 weeks off a year. So I take several smaller 4/5 day trips. Which by the way I am extremely grateful for because this alone is a massive luxury to have. I do save hard for it and it's self funded or from vouchers I'm gifted at Xmas. So I know many women my age are posting their year long back pack trips in Asia and Africa, while I get a 3hr flight to Germany and explore 2 cities over 5 days. But do I compare it , no? I don't know how they fund their trips without work, maybe it's loans, parents, savings. And do I care, no. I'm still en thrilled by my own travels! Stop comparing and realise that travel AT ALL is an absolute luxury.",
      "I did a PhD in a field that was related to my travel interests (which interested me in part because I was interested in specific aspects of those places, in my case history, art, and religion). Then I got teaching jobs in that field and ultimately had a career as an academic. \n\nI was able to get grants to pay for travel expenses and time abroad even as a student. Once I was actually making more money than the minimum required to pay for food and shelter I started talking vacations to places that weren\u2019t related to my research field. \n\nBeing in higher Ed meant that I had enough time where I wasn\u2019t responsible for showing up in a specific place that I could travel for several months a year. I also spent most of my life in VHCOL areas so by subletting my room, and getting the occasional free or paid-for flight, I could afford travel to most of the world. \n\nOf course, there were huge sacrifices involved in this career path. And then I got driven out of my job by nasty colleagues and had to retire early on a pension that isn\u2019t enough for me to live in my home country. \n\nBut overall I\u2019m pretty content with it. Hoping to get back to working for the next ten or fifteen years so I can afford travel to first-world countries, and maybe save up enough to have a place to come back to when I\u2019m really old. \n\nAdvice for people who want to travel affordably: \n\n(1) Be aggressive about exploiting other countries\u2019 economic crises. Argentina in 2003 is the perfect example. Japan right now seems like a good one, too. Choose your destinations because they are cheap right now in your currency. Read the business press to keep abreast of emerging possibilities. \n\n(2) Live in a VHCOL area, preferably with a really tight housing market. That way, once you manage to ensconce yourself in some kind of reasonable housing, you\u2019ll be able to take off at any moment and generate income for your travels by renting out your home to people who need a place for a few weeks or a month.\n\n(3) Get into some kind of work where travel is either actually required, or at least very much a component of how the field operates. The best way to be able to fly for free for decades is to get your employer to pay for it, then piggyback off that flight by taking your vacation where you\u2019ve been sent. \n\n(4) Travel slower. Rather than trying to see all the major European capitals in two weeks, try to see all the small towns in a single corner of a single province of Italy by local bus, or all the villages in a bit of North Holland by bicycle, or every beach town on the coast of Nayarit by taxi.",
      "I often come across these types of solo travelers while on the road:\n\n\t1.\tFresh Graduates: Recent university graduates who use the money saved from summer jobs to explore the world before starting their careers.\n\n\t2.\tHobby Travelers: People with regular 9-to-5 jobs who have a passion for travel. Limited by work or family commitments, they usually take short trips of 1-2 weeks but make the most of their experiences.\n\n\t3.\tSabbatical Travelers: Those taking an extended break from their careers to reset and explore.\n\n\t4.\tDigital Nomads: Individuals with remote jobs that let them work from anywhere. This lifestyle is often romanticized, working abroad versus travelling abroad is not the same. \n\n\t5.\tLow-Budget Travelers: Adventurous travellers who hitchhike, camp and are always cooking food from market. They live on the bare essentials, a lifestyle not everyone can or wants to embrace.\n\n\t6.\tRetirees: After a lifetime of work, they use their savings or pensions to finally enjoy the freedom to explore.\n\n\t7.\tWealthy Travelers: People with significant financial resources or family wealth, enabling them to travel wherever and however they please without constraints.",
      "i think it's mainly two ways, either they have a work from home job that allows them to travel anywhere. i know a guy that codes and designed an app and has been living out of the country and traveling around to different continents since we graduated. he can essentially work anywhere, even for several months he was working off a boat in the atlantic lol. or people are high earners and it may not be obvious, they work and save money in lots of ways for some time and then travel for a while after that. my best friend has done this twice. she had a good job and made good income, had a low cost of living lifestyle and lived at home with her parents to save money, then she quit her job and traveled for 1.5 years. she came back worked for a year and then did it again.\n\nalso, travel really doesn't have to be as expensive as ppl think. maybe the flight to somewhere like thailand or vietnam would be expensive, but you can do hostels and save tons of money, food can be cheap if you're not eating all your meals at expensive restaurants, things like that.\n\ni do agree with you that there is a degree of privilege though to be able to do this. and truthfully, a lot of people don't have longterm travel as a priority."

The best you can do is be healthy (specially gut biome) to increase resistance and most important apply proper hygiene. You can stop diarrhea after contracting it by using imodium or something alike, but it is better to avoid it if reasonably possible. Doctors advice against it, you basically keep the bad microbes inside of you, and if you really need it, it is extremely hard to get right. In my experience it doesn't work or it turns into constipation which may make you feel even more miserable. But if you've important transport to catch it may be the easiest solution.",

If symptoms last longer than a couple days or are severe best to find a good local clinic to help you - travel insurance can be a good resource, your insurance company can provide advice on local medical clinics/hospitals \n\nOtherwise just trying to be cautious within reason about food and drink is a way to try to minimize risk."

I'm spending money on seeing and experiencing new, cool things, sure - but why? I'm taking pictures for my memories and to share with my family and friends, and it makes it feel even more fake and pointless, as if I'm here to just check a box and say \"See where I've been?\" I journal a lot too but it feels just like the pictures at that point.\n\nI have gone on many solo trips before and this is the first time this hits me. I keep thinking about that famous Into the Wild quote: \"Happiness is only real if shared.\" I have a good guess as to why it's hitting me (I'm on this solo trip because the person who was supposed to accompany me after planning this trip together for over a year, and spending several years together, broke up with me just two months ago) but the cause doesn't change the result: this trip of a lifetime feels empty, and traveling solo in general has completely lost its luster. Yes I can do whatever I want, \"find myself\", but why?\n\nThe food I'm eating I could probably find at home because I am fortunate enough to live in a global city. The culture and history is interesting, but then again, what does that bring except some fun facts and pictures to boast about? The language is extremely different from any I know, so despite attempts at learning, connecting with locals is pretty much a dead end, and even then, wouldn't they have pretty much the same dreams and struggles as everyone else in the world?\n\nI'm eating, sleeping, pooping, walking, exploring and living on my own as I would anywhere (including at home).

And bingo. I think I had hoped that I would feel empowered by going on my own to fulfill the travel dream that was supposed to be a shared experience. Instead, everything has been bittersweet and I guess I wondered for a second if this was the solo travel in and of itself. But as with everything in life, context matters. There is wonderful advice in the comments, so thank you everyone, and if anyone is in a similar position, take a look through them! Especially the ones about taking it slow and focusing on doing things that I (and only I) would enjoy. \n\nTo those who just engaged with the question of the post and shared your \u201cwhy\u201d: thank you, because there are some general common trends, but there are also a lot of unique perspectives and it has been a gift to hear so many different insights. \n\nNot all is well, I still cry and feel empty, but I also have moments of feeling cheerful while just sitting on my own as I observe a gorgeous view or enjoy a delicious meal. In those moments I am reminded that this simple, slow contentment is enough and is what solo travel is about. \n\nI hope you keep the insights coming and in the meantime, here\u2019s to life and travel and being human, with all the sweetness and the bitterness.

      "I'm in my late 20s and early in my career, based in the U.S. for context.\n\nRecently, I've been trying to plan some international travel for 2024/2025 (thinking Scotland and Japan), and I've come to realize that most of my friends or potential travel partners fall into these frustrating categories:\n\n1. They can't afford international\u2014or even local travel.\n1. They're focused on their significant other, with their travel plans already set, which makes me feel like I'd be the third wheel. I'd much rather have the freedom of solo travel.\n1. They're saving for a house downpayment or managing a mortgage/rent, so travel just isn\u2019t on their radar.\n1. Their jobs don\u2019t offer enough PTO, so taking 7-14 days off would mean unpaid leave, quitting, or risking their job security.\n\nI've come to rethink the idea that having a close friend on extended international trips always enhances the experience. You quickly learn whether someone is a compatible travel partner, but that depends entirely on their personality and how well they align with your travel values and organizational style. It seems like it\u2019s full of potential for conflict, strained friendships, or just an awkward vibe while you're supposed to be enjoying your time off in another country.\n\nLike the mindset on r/ultralight, I don\u2019t feel the need to bring my social circle along for my travels. I can still enjoy discovering new destinations, sights, and food on my own without needing someone familiar to tag along. \n\nLeave your folks at home, 'cause let's face it - they'll always be there when you fly back home. Don't you want to get away from that anyways?",
      "I think there comes a point where, once you\u2019ve traveled enough, it feels less like this super intense \u201cmagical\u201d new thing and more like a familiar (and still exciting) part of your life. There can be a shift of mindset away from \u201cthis trip will be the coolest thing ever\u201d and more towards \u201cit\u2019ll be fun to see some new cities, try some new food, and get some time to myself.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s okay if a trip is \u201cjust\u201d a trip and not some huge life changing amazing thing. And it\u2019s okay if traveling alone means facing some funky insecurities - you don\u2019t have to feel blissed out all the time in order for the trip to still have meaning and value. \n\nSolo traveling after a heartbreak can also just be a bit of a different headspace. Maybe just embrace that your mood will have its ups and downs, and try to find a healthy balance of embracing some of the fun distractions of traveling, while also giving yourself time to grieve the relationship (can be easier to process those things when you\u2019ve got some time to yourself)\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid also to reach out to some loved ones back home. Sometimes seeing a familiar face in a Zoom call is all you need to get out of a funky mood. \n\nIf the novelty is wearing off you could always consider pushing yourself a bit into more unfamiliar or \u201cchallenging\u201d destinations (within reason). Or you could take a bit of a break from traveling and come back to it feeling (hopefully) rejuvenated later on.",
      "It\u2019s just easy that way. If I want to go somewhere and I have the money I just go. \n\nI am very outgoing so I pretty much always manage to find someone to chat to, at the very least. But I also find my own company quite absorbing and would rather be mostly by myself than try to connect with people I dislike or just find boring. \n\nAlso I have a lot of trouble sleeping, I\u2019m not much of a morning person, and I dislike organized tours. So most people probably would find me a somewhat unsatisfying travel companion.\n\nI go to places I am deeply interested in. I have a life long interest in art history, architecture, and design. I am also a retired historian of the Roman Empire, and interested in everything from the history of religion to military affairs. At the same time, I have an undergraduate degree in biology (not important, except that it gives me a framework for new stuff I learn) and I\u2019m quite interested in nature and the planet. I love the ocean, scuba diving, and birding. I am also very interested in agricultural landscapes, food history, and culinary traditions. I love to eat, drink local cocktails, and just sit at the beach. \n\nYes, it\u2019s nice to share things. I take a lot of casual pictures and text them to a couple of friends back home. \n\nBut if I feel really at sea and lonely, first, I\u2019ve learned that the best way to deal with those feelings is just to acknowledge them, let them in, explore them, and feel sad and lonely if that\u2019s what I\u2019m feeling. I used to reflexively reject and try to suppress bad feelings. Then something happened in my life that totally disrupted my existence and left me with a crippling depression that lasted almost four years (April 2018-March 2022). \n\nAs I started to recover from that, I learned that however horrible a feeling was, it was never actually anything other than a horrible feeling. Emotional pain is not information about the world. It\u2019s not a sign of physical illness (except in the most basic, obvious ways). If can be horrible, but it\u2019s not anything other than what it is. And I found that I was getting better. As I got better, I was able to begin having faith that I would keep getting better. \n\nCrucially, at this point, I moved to a beautiful country and spent over a year just wandering around looking for a perfect place to stay. Then I found it. \n\nNow, if I\u2019m traveling or doing whatever and I get down, I just let those emotions have free rein. Weirdly, it tends to help them dissolve and pass away. Or if not, there\u2019s always tequila \ud83d\ude02.\n\nFinally, I remind myself how much worse in every way it is to be with someone who is making me miserable, than to be by myself and maybe feel bored or lonely.",
      "\u201cWhen you explore who you are, away from everyone who knows who you are, you are your purest self. You learn to leave everything behind when it\u2019s not in alignment with who you want to be. It feels as if a part of you has never returned, and will always stay out there.\n\nSo you continue to return to unknown places, to return to yourself.\u201d\n\nAnd there is always some discomfort! Such is the price of growth. There are times when you are tired or bored or exhausted or home sick or whatever, that\u2019s the price of having the elated moments. \n\n\u201cRisk the bad meal, that\u2019s how you find the miracle meal.\u201d Anthony Bourdain, and this quote can/should/must/lovestobe applied to far more than food! \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but people say travel changes them. I think it\u2019s because you remove yourself completely from the environment that made you believe you are who you are. When you completely disconnect from the people, the places, the customs, the culture, everything...\nit gives you more of an opportunity to see your true self more clearly, without the\nenvironment telling you you\u2019re something else. You\u2019re a blank page.\u201d\n\n\nI don\u2019t solo travel because it\u2019s always fun. \n\nI dont solo travel because it\u2019s easy or simple.\n\nI don\u2019t even REALLY solo travel for the traveling, that\u2019s just a huge 2nd most important part of it.\n\n\n\n\nI solo travel to grow as a person, to find myself and discover what kind of life makes me happy. To heal from my past, to learn to be present in my present, which is of course the only time that is not an illusion. \n\nThere IS no past. i MUST stop living there, even if i do have wounds. I MUST, my life depends on it. \n\nThere IS no future. The future is no place to place your better days. I must Live NOW! I must make now ALWAYS the most important time there it is. I MUST, because now will never come again. \n\n\nSolo travel has taught me mindfulness, and being present. It has helped me to learn skills that help me maintain that happiness, or at least peace with the finite fragility of my blessedly minuscule existence. And for this, I am eternally and immensely grateful.",
      "The point for me is to try new foods, experience different cultures and climates and to generally enrich my life.  I can sit at home alone or I can see the world.",
      "I just want to get out there and see stuff. I'm in my late 30's now and when I look back at my 20's I didn't really do anything. I basically just worked and went out drinking every weekend but I didnt really have many experiences. I hit 30 and wanted to change that, I wanted to see the world and I didnt care if I did that alone or with someone. \n\nIt gives me something to look forward to and I love doing it alone. Sure there are moments when you think it would be nice to be with a friend or a partner. I often get that feeling when I stop for some food or a beer somewhere but it doesn't ruin my trip. I'm used to it now and I love the freedom of being alone.",
      "I went through a break up and from 2 months after moving out I started travelling too. I experienced something similar. I missed sharing my life with him. It also made me sad when I noticed that everyone (99%) was travelling with someone. Seeing public displays of affection was the worst. \n\nI think at those moments though, I would then try to do something to treat myself that only I like, and noticing the small details that makes travelling solo better. I travelled very well with my ex, but there's always things you have to compromise on when you travel with someone else.\n\nFor example: I (female) can go to the toilet however many times I want without feeling bad, I can eat some foods also at home (London has everything) so I'll google the weirdest or most local thing around me and try it without discussing with anyone, I can determine my own narrative without sharing it with others, I can catch up on reading whilst eating alone or enjoy people watching in peace without worrying about being boring, I can walk around tourist attractions at exactly the speed I want, I eat when I want, I can souvenir shop for as long as I want, don't need to worry about my partner overspending, I can take a break on a hike when I want, I can go to the beach and stare into space if I randomly felt like it. Part of it is also choosing places to travel that contrast where you live.\n\nI've also been visiting friends abroad whilst travelling which gave me the biggest contrast, I love my friends, but it made me appreciate my freedom. Couples mostly do turn into a blob with limited individuality, only a few couples I know I'm genuinely inspired by their healthy relationship.\n\nFor a big part, I missed my ex. I missed sharing with the person I was going to marry just a few months ago, I'll fidget where my engagement ring was, but it was also a journey to rediscover things that I love that makes me an individual. At home, there's responsibilities, stresses and a lot of other people's opinions you have to listen to, so whilst travelling solo it's been easier to focus on treating myself to what I want to do if I had zero responsibilities (don't even need to clean or cook) and only listen to myself. Even the missing my ex part, I can miss my ex without people judging me and mourn the death of my relationship without people pitying me or knowing my ex is a reachable distance. It's making it a conscious decision of stepping onto your own path and making it the best choice even if the other path was really nice.",
      "Sometimes I feel that way when I solo travel. What helps is meeting other people and learning about their lives. Even if I cant speak to locals, I\u2019ve learned surprising things from other travelers. Yes, we may have similar dreams and struggles, but we all have unique experiences and personalities to share.\n\nSo at the end of the day, the sights and food are good (edit: bonus is not having to plan around others) but the people are what keep me going back to solo travel.",
      "I'll be honest it does ....have a tinge* of loneliness and pain at times being travel versed and not having a partner or anyone i take with me - it's seldom I meet others either who truly do go out on their own ? Usually people meet someone they know or whatnot along the way .....but I have been truly traveling alone for some time now. Things as simple as restaurants to full fledge multistage traveling. Airplanes and driving to boot. I'll say there's this sense of adventure and self discovery that fuels me....when your traveling with others u still have to cross check - every decision is pondered more or less - to make sure all parties involved are happy w the r3sult ? Where as ...single....u can r3ally act on spontaneous feelings or last minute  ...there's truly this freeing aspect to not having to consider anyon3 else and only for yourself - that feeling is what i chase. And when I'm some place new desicoverjng something on my own for my own - the reward in accomplishment feels really really good. Alot of the time in nervous or scared for no reason while others I may misunderstanding how hard or dangerous something is being naive. All the same their MY lessons to learn without interfere...and that is when I learn the most of things. New environment per say - the weird ambiance of nerves and not knowing what to expect- and then that feeling of overcoming it all to have a great experience? Its ....a feeling i can't match doing anything else. Even recently I went to NYC for the first time alone no plan lol my hotel didn't accept my payment and my jeep broke down on my way home hahaha but !!! I learned so much from that trip ! Met now life long friends- had great food and wandered much of the city got to see amazing things. Ther3 were moments I thought \"this would be amazing sharing the view and food\"- but at the same time it was all that more special having the moment to myself - moments ill never forget. I was scared being there alone not having a clue ...of cours3 I was lol but you learn as you go how to protect yourself as a single person . I carry a knife and emergency gear everytime. I'm careful I don't give out my number or hotel while I'm out things like that - public areas.  But I think the adventure and freedom more or less is what i chase. I had been so focused on the fact I had no-one to share the moments with that I stopped trying to cr3ate them. That's my only regret that for a time....I stopped being the modern nomad I am ? Lol but the truth is - if you feel something lacking in your life...it starts with you*. Other people cannot make you happy fill those voids heal those wounds. And we all hardly have lives we can stop and smell the roses for - but you have to want it more <3 if you love traveling and learning and growing as a person I dare say solo travel is for you.  It takes some getting used to - but like everything u gain confid3nce as you go. The only way to find out ...is to go for it <3 for me that balance of adredanline not knowing - and the things I learn about myself and the world are always worth the trip . Someday ....id love to have company...but for now...my solo trips serve me well <3",
      "1. I don\u2019t have (m)any people to go with\n\n2. I\u2019m a control freak and want to do what I want, when I want. I don\u2019t wanna spend $$ on something I don\u2019t want to do, and I don\u2019t want to make someone do the same for things I want to do.\n\n3. Solo travel is easier because it requires less planning and coordination than traveling with others. You can be a lot more laissez-faire and go with the flow. Traveling can also be very challenging on your relationship with the others involved because of the stressful situations you\u2019re put through. This can be ultimately rewarding, but it\u2019s a risky move. You may come out the other side hating each other.\n\n4. You can learn a lot about yourself solo traveling. My solo travels have been an intense journey in philosophy and self-understanding. I\u2019ve grown immensely from each adventure.\n\n5. Hard disagree with your point that seeing things alone is pointless. I just don\u2019t get the \u201cthis is only worth it for social clout\u201d mindset. There are plenty of reasons to go see/experience things that don\u2019t involve other people. A beautiful view is still breathtaking if you see it by yourself, no? Aren\u2019t the history and culture still fascinating? Isn\u2019t the food still delicious? Even if no one else knows about the moments you experienced, even if Instagram or family or friends don\u2019t see the photos you took or hear the stories you share, you still carry them with you! Solo traveling is something that must be done for _you_.\n\n6. You can still be social when solo traveling. Some of my best memories are with the people I met abroad. Being solo forced me to put myself out there and get to know the locals, thusly the culture a lot more. I now have (hopefully) lifelong friendships with folks from all over!",
      "You're grieving. You planned the trip together and now you are alone. That's the reason.\n\nI traveled a lot and more than half of those i did solo. While there are times that i felt some activities need to be done with someone i know, i really enjoyed traveling alone. For tours and activities, i join groups (try GetYourGuide, Klook or Viator), so i'm not really alone...\n\nWhat keeps me going? I'm in my 50+ countries and still excited to be in new places, to meet new people, to taste new foods and to experience new adventures! Sure, i would love to share this passion with someone, hopefully in the future... But one thing i learned from traveling solo is to be truly independent and not depend my happiness with other human being.",
      "I'm a solo backpacker and have taken several trips to Southeast Asia, Australia and Central Asia in my 20s. I chose solo travel because I enjoy the adventure of being on my own, or maybe I enjoy being in solitude and also being able to do things spontaneously during trips. These journeys provided me with memorable experiences, adventures, and the fate to meet people who hold a special place in my heart.\n\nNow that I've just started my 30s, I recently went on a 10-day solo backpacking trip to Almaty, Kazakhstan. At this age, travelling solo brings a new perspective; it feels more like a journey of slowing down, inspiration, and spending time with myself. There's a quote from a movie: 'Happiness is only real when shared.' But what if we can share it with ourselves, treating ourselves as a best friend or companion who will always be with us? It's like befriending myself. During this trip, time seemed to stop. I paid close attention to my surroundings, the smiles and greetings from people, the autumn leaves falling, and the two hours spent in a cafe enjoying food and tea, simply observing without much thought.\n\nIt is a good experience to be able to see someone's life running their errands on a usual day, while we are away from our daily activities that allow us to be free to immerse in.   \nHowever, I'm not restricting myself to always travelling solo. I'm more about going with the flow; I like the idea of not knowing what will happen next, what I will see, or who I will meet during the journey, so I allow myself to simply go with the flow.\n\nAt this point, solo travel is more like a form of self-love and self-discovery, also an inspiring way to understand the world and perhaps serendipitously encounter the reasons why we stay alive for. It reassures that we are never truly alone. And that's the hope that keeps me going."

A whisked egg is poured in a skillet, topped with cheese and herbs, tortilla on top, flip and fold when the egg is cooked so the tortilla gets crispy on the outside, similar to a quesadilla.

For reference, I stayed on Canal Street, easy walking distance to the French quarter, and only saw other parts of the city on my rides to/from the airport, so maybe that skews my perspective. \n\nPositives:\nThe food.   Every meal,  even the catered ones at the hotel, were excellent.  I love Cajun & Seafood, and got my fix for sure.  Even the fried chicken I got at the chicken & daiquiri shop was very good.\n\nThe culture:  history, music, etc was everywhere and easy to get into.  The national WW2 Museum was excellent.\n\nThe airport was even very nice. \n\nNegatives:\nDirty and smelly.  The whole place needs to be power washed and scrubbed by 1 million moms.  Everything looked dingy.  More trash dumped wherever than most other places I've been.   Didn't we learn to stop littering back in the 70-80's?\n\nThe homeless.  So many of them,  unwashed, noisome, asking for handouts and talking to themselves (or the voices in their heads).  More than a few obviously tripping on something. \n\nThe traffic.  A 15 mile trip between the airport to my hotel took at least 35-40 minutes in bumper to bumper traffic,  at off-peak drive times. I hope the rest of the city isn't that bad. \n\nOverall:\nIt was fine for me for the 4 days I was there.

But I also carefully planned my London trip and tagged along with \"fly by the seat of their pants\" style inlaws for the Spain trip so really my point is that I think everywhere has excellent food if you do some presearch.",
      "Poland has waaaay better food than I expected. And the Netherlands has worst food than what I expected.",
      "Better: Ireland. Had some wonderful seafood dishes and just phenomenally delicious brown bread everywhere.  \nWorse: Czech Republic. Damn I was just begging for some vegetables after two days.",
      "Worse than expected: Cuba 100%. \nI grew up in FL eating amazing Cuban food.  I learned if you want good Cuban food, go to FL, NOT Cuba\n\nBetter than expected: Dubai. \nDubai gets a lot of hate, but get away from the malls and fancy restaurants, and go to where the working class immigrants live and eat.  Its hard to find a city with so many diverse, unique and authentic options",

We tried a varied slice of the cuisine from street food to a few fine restaurants and it was pretty... meh?    \n\n\nTo be fair, we had also just been in Italy less than a week before so maybe that was causing some bias.",
      "Everyone gives Ireland and UK a bad food reputation, but it\u2019s good. Especially the home cooking. They have a good mix of veggies, carb and meats. Their desserts are awesome too. Peru lacks good desserts. They are very bland and the cake is terrible. Peru has good Chinese food and ceviche, but they lack dairy and fresh veggies.",
      "Better: Iceland.  Everyone says how expensive and bland it is but I found the food to be high quality and reasonable given the country\u2019s geography.\n\nWorse: Cuba.  Worst food by a mile in 50+ countries visited. But you can\u2019t really fault it given their political-economic situation.",
      "Colombia had many great qualities but the typical food is quite bland. Colombians don\u2019t do spice so they don\u2019t even put pepper on their food. \n\nPeru has the best food. Lima has many great restaurants, from the highest ranked restaurant in the world to lots of smaller ones, to lots of Chinese and Japanese food.",

      "Worse than expected: pupusas from El Salvador. They were small and dry. Not juicy and fat like the ones made in Los Angeles. For crying out loud, it\u2019s the birthplace of pupusas :(\n\nBetter than expected: London. They have a bad rep for taste but they\u2019re fish and chips, and Indian food were on fire.",
      "Better than expected: Ireland (best Indian food I had was in Northern Ireland), Mexico (did not get sick, been several times to different states in Mx)Mexico has a good balance and spices. Bosnia was awesome! They had Arabic desserts, so good.\nWorse than expected: France\nBest: Italy, Jordan, Spain\nWorst: Finland, Iceland, Colombia",

      "Worse than expected: Netherlands, and mind you, I had already set my expectations very low (as I do most times I have to go north). What amazes me is that the Dutch cuisine practically is non existent apart for a couple of mediocre dishes.\n\nBetter than expected: United Kingdom. Or better to say, the Cornish food I had the opportunity to try was great.",
      "Czech Republic had amazing food. I still miss the mustard chips and schnitzel.",
      "I had very high expectations for food in Malaysia and I could not believe how much better the food was. Utterly amazing for nearly every meal. High end to street food, in fact especially the street food all first class.\n\nItaly was pretty poor all things considered.",
      "you didn't expect good food in Rome and Naples?",
      "London is a poor place to have good fish and chips in the UK. The coast is the place to find great fish and chips (dredgers in Whitley Bay is my personal pick, probably due to nostalgia in part, they still fry in beef tallow). \n\nCountry that surprised me was Cambodia, didn\u2019t expect it to be anywhere even remotely close to Vietnam as was my stop after there however every meal was excellent! Also Poland, generally been great food.  \n\nDisappointing, probably\u2026..the Netherlands. I know it\u2019s not exactly well known, I\u2019ve just had so, so many bad meals there compared to anywhere else (except breakfast for some reason, always had great breakfasts there).",
      "The surprisingly great food was in Myanmar, Cambodia and South Africa.\n\nMyanmar because the local food is influenced by its neighbours India, Thailand and India, but is uniquely Burmese.\n\nCambodia because of a national dish called Amok, which is a fish stew served in a coconut and deliciously aromatic, and also its hotpot which includes a grill for cooking the protein on. Absolutely delicious!\n\nSouth Africa where the standard of cuisine is very high, particularly Bunny Chow which is a light curry served inside a loaf of bread.  But also because South African wines are sensational.\n\nThe most boring was Switzerland as the food was bland, but I did have the best hot chocolate there that I have ever tasted.\n\nSpecial mention to London where I had the worst meal (steak and kidney pie) that I have ever tasted (and I normally like steak and kidney pie). Also jellied eels, which is like chewing on used condoms.\n\nThe rest of the UK was fine, and country pubs serve great food.",
      "Malaysia is absolute #1 and I will die on this hill. Penang food culture was fuckn insane with the most incredible food I\u2019ve ever had in my life. I\u2019ve traveled a lot of the world, with my dad being Italian (been to Italy many times), and mom from Uruguay (a lot of meat), so I think I have a decent palate, but Malaysia was just god tier. \n\nChile was kind of whatever, and I think because Peru does the exact same but better, plus they have their Japanese fusion going on. I lived in Chile for a year so I think I have a good knowledge of it.",
      "UK, much better than expected, Italy, worse than expected. I found it quite difficult to actually find great fresh pasta in Italy. Lots of good food still, just unexpectedly more average food than expected, and limited veggies.\n\nUK, London specifically, can't beat a really good Sunday Roast or the exceptional Indian food. World wide cuisine everywhere.",
      "Better than expected: Japan. Okay, I didn't expect it to be bad by any means. But dish-wise I was really only familiar with sushi, from eating it in western countries where the quality is notably worse. But there's so much more to it. And I had always *hated* sak\u00e9 whenever I tried it in America or Europe. But in Japan I grew fond of it. Now it's probably my second favorite variety of food after Vietnamese. The only drawback is that, having spent 3 weeks in Japan last fall, I can no longer eat sushi in any other country because it's just not the same.\n\nWorse than expected: Germany. I moved here from America and was really keen on eating lots of German food at first, but the staples of German cuisine got old really fast. I think baked goods are where most northern European cuisines really shine, but there's only so much bread and pastry I can handle.",
      "Argentina - everyone knows about their steak, which I agree is great. The empanadas were fine, and we sampled from a few different places. But the rest of the food was severely underwhelming. We only stayed in Buenos Aires, so maybe food in other parts of the country is better.",
      "I liked the food in Belgium a lot more than I thought I would.  No one really talks about Belgian food, so I wasn't expecting much.  It was all good though - high quality, well-prepared.  \n\nWorse than expected - I guess Costa Rica.  The food wasn't bad or anything - plenty of fresh produce, I liked the gallo pinto (I can eat rice and beans all day every day), but it was a little on the repetitive side.",
      "Australia had amazing food -  hadn\u2019t expected that! Everything was so fresh and the presentation, even at little basic spots, was always so thoughtful! We travelled from Hamilton Island, then to Sydney, and then road-tripped down to Melbourne. We still talk about these potatoes we had with a side of the most delicious sour cream and sweet chili sauce at a totally random breakfast spot. Really was very impressed.",
      "Wayyy better than expected: Peru \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddea. I learned that they actually have won top spot in international cuisine awards, and I could understand why once I had tried their food. Overrated: France. Some things are wonderful, but a lot of it is pretty bland.",
      "I didn\u2019t like most of the food in Barcelona and Madrid which was a bummer.  Beautiful cities though \u2764\ufe0f",
      "Cambodia has great food.  I think they get overlooked because their neighbors Thailand and Vietnam have food that is better known worldwide.\n\nI listened to people say how good Turkish food was.  Giant nope.  If I went back, I'd pack a Costco-sized bottle of Sriracha.",
      "Better than expected: Peru. Its cuisine is a real sleeper. So good. \n\nWorse than expected: Iceland. And I had low expectations. At least I got to eat a lot of hotdogs.\n\nAlso Honduras. Such bad food.",
      "Better than expected: Maldives. I ventured outside the tourist areas and the food is excellent.\u00a0\n\nWorse than expected: Indonesia. Not that it wasn\u2019t good, but I had recently been to Malaysia and was spoiled by how incredible Malaysian cuisine was and was kind of let down thinking their neighbor would have food that was at that sale level.\u00a0",
      "Best: Newfoundland, Canada. I was expecting the food to be dreary; similar to the worst impressions people have about Irish and British cuisine. But the fresh fish and wild game (it's the only place in Canada where they legally can put game on restaurant menus) was truly extraordinary. We went to a restaurant where the chef made ravioli with meat from wild rabbits that he himself hunted. \n\nWorst: Yeah, Colombia was bad; but I was only 20 when I went there. I didn't know anything about fine cuisine then! Sinaloa, Mexico was a bit of a dissapointment coming from someone who lives next to Baja California. Sinaloans always brag about how thei seafood is the best in MX and especially better than Baja's...I just didn't see it.",
      "Romania has amazing food. I never expected that",
      "Paris, France.   \nBest food: India, London, Milan/Florence/Lake Como.",
      "Went to Spain for a month last year. I really was not impressed with the food at all. On the contrary, when I went to Italy I thought all the talk about Italian food was just people hyping it way too up. Every meal I had in Italy was delicious and the hype was well deserved.",
      "Bali had the worst. Even did a cooking class where we ground our own spices and such. Still not great. \n\nBest food was Thailand. Did not expect a flavor punch to the mouth in such a good way!",
      "I loved the food in Ireland.  I thought much of the food I had in Italy (Tuscany mostly) was boring.  I understand this is near blasphemous and I apologize.",
      "Mostar Bosnia had the best food I\u2019ve eaten in my entire life, Had some kind of meat stew loaded with sour cream. And also close second was the Paella I had on Formentera right off the beach. \n\n\nWorst was in Germany at a Christmas market, it was some kind of sausage on a stick, It just wasn\u2019t good at all.",
      "I have a similar story, I thought the food in France would be much better than it was. It was great at times but on average it was just average. I expected the food in Italy to be good but was surprised by how good it was. There were a couple clunkers of course but overall it was worth the visit just for the food.",
      "The food in Vienna was delicious, and I had no idea it was going to be so good",
      "I was really disappointed in Croatian food honestly. I expected it to be excellent quality because I usually love Mediterranean food, but the produce was just okay and the fish dishes that locals raved about were not particularly flavorful.",
      "Worse than expected: Croatia (or maybe I just ate at mediocre places)\n\nBetter than expected: Thailand - I had high expectations and the food was amazing",
      "Brazil has food better than I expected. Spain had food worse than I expected.",
      "Better than expected: Bulgaria. Bulgarian cuisine just isn\u2019t known internationally. At all. I didn\u2019t have any expectations, but was surprised to learn that it was so tasty! It was a bit like Greek/Georgian/Ukrainian fusion, if I had to make a comparison. Lots of fresh veggies, amazing meat marinades, and great use of spices that infuse flavour. So many amazing restaurants that make food that tastes homemade in a grandma\u2019s kitchen. \n\nMore disappointing than expected: Tanzania, I suppose? As someone who\u2019s had my fair share of African food I expected more flavourful stews tbh, especially as a country that grows spices and has Indian influence. Found Tanzanian food surprisingly kind of bland.",
      "Japan. You have to cash out your retirement plan to have good Japanese food in the US. The food in Japan is cheaper and wayyy better. Even their 7/11 food if unpacked and plated nicley could\u2019ve fooled me.",
      "Poland has better food than expected; I had much higher expectations for the Netherlands, but left there disappointed.",
      "Peru:  TOTALLY INCREDIBLE SEAFOOD ASIAN FUSION\nArgentina:  Underwhelming.  Just steak and potatoes.",
      "Better than expected:  \n- Italy. I knew it would be good, but holy shit, it's next level.  \n- Bosnia. I didn't actually have any expectations, but the meat platters are insane.    \n\nWorse than expected:  \n- Not really a foodie country, but didn't care for much in the Netherlands.",
      "Seriously, what food did you have in Israel? It's a massive mix between Levantine, European, and American food.",
      "Surprised people disliked the food in Israel, I thought it was fantastic.  So fresh. Strawberries the size of my fist!  Fresh and amazing variety of salads, different fish, grilled veggies and of course hummus.  I never felt so healthy.",
      "Maybe it's just me, but I was disappointed in Spanish food.",
      "I won't play it safe by saying Italy (in any case, as long as you stay in the Mediterranean area, you can't go wrong) . I don't know if it was the best I've ever tried, but since Georgia was already mentioned, I'll go with Singapore. You can find a great variety of food, western, Asian, Indian... You name it! It's just an amazing place for foodies. \nFor meat lovers, I'd like to mention Namibia. It's just incredible how tasty meat is down there. \nWorst experience for me was probably (and ironically) Ireland, not because of the traditional dishes, but I've found the average quality of the Irish restaurants quite disappointing.",
      "Spain. The food is very repetitive (ie no variation from eatery to eatery) and lack lustre.",
      "Peru. Hands down, best country for food. I\u2019ve been to 40 countries and eaten some good meals around the world, but give me some ceviche, aj\u00ed de gallina, lomo saltado, pisco sour maracuya, and sweet potato donuts any day of the week. Oh, and chaufa. And patarachka.\n\nParaguay\u2026food looked good on the plate, hardly any flavor. There for five days, every meal was bland. Maybe I had COVID, but I don\u2019t think so.",
      "This is going to piss people off but Vietnam banh mi consistently missed the mark for me after having had so many incredible ones in Australia. They seem to be a lot more savoury and fast food-like in Vietnam. Four friends who recently went had the same experience sadly.",
      "Sri Lanka has the best food i\u2019d ever had and ive been to 69 countries. Followed by Malaysia. Food in both places was sublime, beyond description in words. I\u2019ll never stop thinking about the food. Colombia was the worst. It\u2019s interesting for me to hear that others had the same experience.",
      "Argentina exceeded expectations, not just Buenos Aires but also C\u00f3rdoba, Mendoza and in some rural locations as well. Incredible steaks, meats and accompaniments, and the non-Argentinian food was incredible too.\n\nIn contrast, Colombia was rubbish - decent food in places but considering a lot of people raved about its food, particularly Americans, it was rubbish. Think it might be because it\u2019s very Americanised food, lots of sweet breads etc. literally everything pumped full of corn syrup. the best meal I ate there was sushi in a Japanese restaurant.",
      "You didn't expect good food in Rome and Naples?",
      "Bulgaria and Serbia. \n\nFood was absolutely amazing in both. \n\nI really didn\u2019t like the food in the Philippines but I\u2019m not sure if I had the good stuff.",
      "Germany was not my favorite (although I do have a love for gingerbread now thanks to German Christmas markets)\n\nHeaviest hitter for best cuisine is India for the variety of cuisines and multiple flavors (but was already partial to Indian food so I do have a bias). I sure paid for it on the way home though \ud83d\ude2d",
      "Better than expected, the UK. Every meal was great and I'm not sure why people complain so much about it. Didn't even eat very fancy food.",
      "I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not seeing more Mexico City shoutouts. I got 15 tacos (chosen from like 10 varieties) and two tall boy beers delivered within 25 minutes for $8 off a delivery app (Rappi) that covers basically every restaurant and store in the city. There\u2019s no language barrier in the app, so it makes everything stupidly easy. Delivery is like $0.75. That was probably the worst culinary experience I had and it was a delicious and satisfying revelation. \n\nMexico City hasn\u2019t been graded by Michelin yet, and there is an apparent but unacknowledged arms race among the restaurants. I went to lunch at a place that was less than $20 for three courses and they took me up to meet the entire kitchen staff, see what they were all cooking, give me a sample of all of the other dishes being cooked that I hadn\u2019t ordered, and explain the influences that inspired the head chef to come up with each of the meals I sampled, and my own. It was absurd. I did a little bit of research to make reservations on Open Table but not more than two days in advance.\n\nMexico City was under French control for like five years and the lasting effect is that their bakeries are way, way better than I expected. They kept that influence from the French and basically nothing else, and there are great Mexican baked goods that merely benefit from French baking skill supporting them. \n\nI went to a restaurant called Animal - Masaryk and asked the server what I should order. I don\u2019t argue with experts and I knew I\u2019d be happy with whatever he said, but he recommended the most basic taco on the menu\u2014which has a lot of fancy dishes like bone marrow and stuff, so I said \u201cWhy would you recommend a taco I can get on the street for a tenth of that price?\u201d He said \u201cYou can get that kind of taco, but it won\u2019t be this good. Do what you want, but that\u2019s my favorite dish on the menu.\u201d So I decided to roll with it, and let me tell you\u2026 I think about those tacos\u2014tortilla, steak, onion, cilantro, lime, served deconstructed for self-assembly\u2014once a month and it\u2019s been over a year since I had them. They came out in blazing cast iron to keep the meat hot and tortillas steamed. The other ingredients were just in dishes. I can\u2019t tell you why I can\u2019t make those tacos, or why the guys on the street can\u2019t make those tacos. I saw every ingredient and they are readily available to anyone. But I can tell you I will never make a taco that good and the ones on the street don\u2019t compare. \n\nI haven\u2019t even mentioned the fresh churros with chocolate, Nutella, etc. that are seemingly in every cafe.\n\nI had the best avocado of my life sliced over steak in an airport restaurant on a layover in Monterrey. That one avocado taught me why the cartels are diversifying into avocados. Those things put a Hass to shame.\n\nMexico City is a foodie paradise. It\u2019s worth the trip for the food alone, and people are only starting to talk about it. Oh, and my AirBnB was $13/night, across the street from the Mexican pentagon, in one of the nicer neighborhoods, secured with a doorman, deadbolt, and separately locked bedroom. \n\nBetween meals, go see Luchador Wrestling for $20, the unbelievable anthropological museum, ballet folklorico, and go take an AirBNB guided tour of Teotihuacan. Go to the artisan market (it actually has the cheapest prices you\u2019ll find in Mexico City or the rest of the country) and talk to the kid behind the counter at the artisan hot chocolate and tequila stand with three metal stools. He\u2019ll make you whatever you want for like a dollar, and he\u2019s as generous with his knowledge as he is with his time and his tasters.\n\nI\u2019ll take anyone\u2019s recommendations for Mexico / Mexico City, because I want to go back again and again, for a week, or just for lunch.",
      "Better than expected - Laos - Big focus on fresh vegetables, lean proteins, strong flavors. I'm a huge fan of Thai food so Laotian food was right up my alley. I want spicy, sour, tangy, bold flavors and Laotian food didn't disappoint. Nice regional options and varieties to explore, each with very distinctly different tastes, etc.\n\nWorse than expected - Singapore - Large focus on carbs, few fresh veggies, overly salted. Tried all the hawker staples and the stuff like chili crab, laksa, chicken rice, etc. Just not a fan of it. Food tasted overly seasoned, overly salty, or overly sweet. Not saying the food was bad, just that it wasn't as good as I was expecting.",
      "I hate saying this, because it gets dumped on so much, but... Dubai had much worse food than I was expecting.  I now realize that what I had thought of as \"Middle Eastern food\" mostly pertains to countries on the Mediterranean, so it may not have been fair to expect amazing falafel and the like.  But I still more or less expected it to be better than what I could get in the US. It's not garbage or anything, but it was all just \"not bad\" or \"decent.\"\n\nDesserts were fantastic there, though.  You're not getting mohalabia or moufrakeh that good anywhere in the US.  Also I only wanted to eat local cuisine, so it's entirely possible Dubai has like the world's best French restaurants or something, but thats not what I'm going for when I travel, unless I'm actually in France.",
      "Mediocre and confusing: Spain\u2026..I really tried branching out and went to different cities but overall I found the food to be generally fried and bland. Also I don\u2019t get the obsession with jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico. Like it\u2019s good, but damn they are really obsessed with it over there. \n\nBest food that surprised me: Peru\u2026..seafood and ceviche\u2019s are amazing. Much different than the Mexican food I\u2019m used to. I even tried Guinea pig in Cusco lol",
      "China. The food was amazing!! I even had street food and survived!! It was great.",
      "Wasn't very fond of Indonesian food, altho had some pretty good more up-scale Indonesian food in Jakarta, but Jogja and Bali I found both pretty meh\n\n  \nI was pleasantly surprised with the food in Czechia/Austria, schnitzel and goulash and the beer are all incredible",
      "Cyprus- worse than expected. Not bad, just nothing that\u2019s rocked my boat.\n\nSurprised by your experience in Israel! I thought the food was absolutely incredible. Did you eat any seafood? \n\nBetter than I thought: Costa Rica. Everything was just so fresh and flavorful. It was all basic food but each item tasted better than the US version.",
      "Is this question about the quality and appeal of the cuisine? Or about the specific experiences of eating that cuisine in that location?\n\nExample:  \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to enjoy Vietnamese food as much as I did\u201d versus \u201cI like Vietnamese food but was surprised how often the quality of the meals in restaurants disappointed me there\u2026\u201d. I\u2019ve never been to Vietnam so this is just an example.\n\nFor me I would say that overall in many countries the average meal in the local cuisine has eroded in the past ten years.  Things the French or Italian dining public, for example wouldn\u2019t have tolerated ten years ago are somewhat more commonplace now.  \n\nI chalk this up to the inevitable erosion of the ownership of middle of the market elements of the supply chain\u2014corporations taking over local restaurants, food purveyors consolidating, etc.  \n\nHigh end places are getting better in many ways, both in terms of creating products bound for higher end outlets such as restaurants and shops, while the middle is getting much worse."

That works great if you can store the leftovers (which it is common to box up and take with you), but a hotel mini fridge will get full quickly!",

You may encounter suggested tips on the screen when you pay for your order, but you can just bypass that or enter zero. However, it is still nice to carry a few dollars cash and drop a dollar or two into the tip jar (if they have one) if and only if the person taking your order was exceptionally helpful or the experience was otherwise somehow extraordinary.",

      "I always spend less when by myself in this situation, fast food or fast casual would easily fit your budget. My government per diem would be close to your amount.

      "That's more than enough unless you expect fine dining. Corporate chains like Chili's etc will serve lunch or dinner options for about $20-25 and the quality will be far superior to that found at any chain restaurant in the UK (looking at you Frankie & Benny's).\n\nTypical fast food has gotten more expensive, but even so, $20 should fill you up easily.",
      "Yeah that's enough, just don't go splurging on the fancy restaurants.\n\nMy average restaurant meal comes out to $20 in cost. $15 would be on the cheap end (fast food, fast casual), and $25 would be a standard sit-down restaurant prices (tax and tip included).\n\nIf you eat stuff like steak and crab and lobster it's gonna hit the $35-$50 mark, though. So if the budget is looking a bit tight just order chicken, potato, and corn (tortilla included) dishes. They are cheap, filling, abundant, and corn is very American in that you see it way more in N. and S. American cuisine than in Eurasia and Africa.\n\nAlso I guess it also depends on your alcohol consumption. Drinks are always the most overpriced items on any menu. If you don't drink alcohol it makes that budget much more comfy.",
      "Will your hotel have a small kitchen? If you\u2019re able to cook lunch or dinner (and store food in the fridge) for yourself half the time, that will give you more wiggle room for those more expensive places you may want to try.

      "More than enough especially if you like Mexican food. Plenty for fast casual restaurants serve beer and wine.",
      "The US government meal Per-Diem for Denver is $80, so you're getting a bit less than that. Maybe ask your company to match the US Per-Diem. But even $62 per day is definitely doable. You could spend a lot more if you ate at a fancy place for every meal, or spend a lot less if you went to some less expensive places. \n\nIf it was me and I didn't need to show the company receipts, I would buy some stuff to make sandwiches or other food you can prepare in your hotel room for an occasional meal and pocket the money you save.",
      "Post-COVID, Denver has gone through what I\u2019d describe as a \u201chollowing out\u201d process in the restaurant scene. A bunch of mid-priced non-chain restaurants went under. While there are still a few places around that fit that description, most of your choices are at the low end (fast food or counter-type fast casual), or upper end (mains at $25-plus, and higher).\n\nMy wife and I went to a diner on Saturday (very casual place you\u2019d have described as \u201creasonably cheap\u201d a few years ago), where we shared one dinner salad, one order of fish & chips, and she had a milkshake for dessert. With tax and 20% tip, bill came to $43.20.\n\nIf you want some good recommendations, message me and I\u2019m happy to help. I\u2019ve been in Denver since 1982. Hope you have a pleasant trip!",

But you are eating at unpretentious locations\u2026. Fast food, food trucks, burger stands, etc. $20 - $30 will cover most meals.  I only eat 2x a day so it would work for me, but if you\u2019re trying to eat 3 full meals, and any alcohol you might go over budget.",
      "Yeah, that's fine.  When I travel I allocate $50 a day for food, drinks and snacks.  It's more in the range of fast-food/diner-sit-down lunches and moderate-priced local-or-chain restaurant dinners.  Probably enough to allow for *some* splurging with a fine dining or pricier items every once in a while.",
      "For cheap meals for breakfast and lunch, you could probably have a pretty ok dinner with what's left over. There are TONS of cheap food options in most places. I'd recommend looking at what you want for dinner early in the day so you can budget around that.",
      "For one person? Absolutely. Don't go eating filet mignon or lobster. But you can get healthy decent food, yes.",
      "American grocery stores are huge and a good option to save a few bucks. Whole Foods usually has a great prepared food section, but most good stores have a counter that makes great sandwiches and has rotisserie chicken or fried chicken with decent sides. It's quick, you can make some healthy choices, and cheap. Also, check your hotel for access to a microwave or something like that. 40 days is a long time--sometimes you just want to grab something and eat and not deal with service. I'm in Atlanta--not a cheap town. The other day I picked up fresh sushi and some Chinese buns for $12. Buns took 45 sec in the microwave and were perfect.",
      "Easy to that. In fact there are plenty of places to eat that are cheap in Denver. If you\u2019re downtown finding a cheap lunch won\u2019t take much. If you eat bar food your beer cost will be more than food. There are a lot of bars to get food as well. Prepared food is taxed so be aware of that. You can keep a few extra pennies in your pocket as well by making sure that when you tip that you figure out the food cost. They have started to suggest tipping on the total bill after adding in the taxes. If you go somewhere that does that and don\u2019t want to figure it out then calculate maybe 15% of the total bill if you are generous. I hate tipping culture here anyway so don\u2019t feel bad if you feel that poor service doesn\u2019t deserve much of a tip. 20% is becoming normalized as a low end tip with some places suggesting 28%. It is all over the place so don\u2019t feel guilty if someone thinks it is not enough you won\u2019t hear them complain in London. Enjoy the country while you are here. Unless you work every day here you should be able to get into the mountains of Colorado they are amazing.",
      "There are $12-14 lunch meal deals in Whole Foods. Sprouts has high-quality sandwiches even cheaper. Find a high-quality grocery store nearby and eat there. No need to tip, too.\u00a0",
      "The short answer is yes, if you were grocery shopping, $65 could get you by for the week. But if you're eating out for every meal, you will have to be more strategic.\n\nFYI, Denver's inflation has been exceptionally high for dining out. So while Denver may not *technically* be seen as as expensive as NYC or LA, it's restaurant scene might come close.\n\nFor example, many sit-down restaurants have implemented \"living-wage\", or other percentage-based charges on top of the check, *in addition to* the tip you're expected to leave. So if you're not careful, you might sit down for 3 x $5 tacos, and after tax, their living wage charge, and tip, you just spend $35 instead of $15.\n\nThat said, just mix in some counter-service/fast casual meals in addition to sit-down restaurants, and you'll be fine\n\nTipping rules: If you get table service, 20% is normal/expected. Whereas if you get counter service, a few dollars. Maybe 10%. Nothing is required. (Some people debate this). Bartenders, however: 20%.\n\nHere are some affordable, can't-miss, fast-casual or take out places to eat:\n\n1. Illegal Pete's (fast-casual Mexican)\n2. Maria Empanada\n3. Pete's Kitchen - classic, heavy, American diner food\n4. Redeemer Pizza - affordable if you get a slice or two\n5. Taco trucks you see on the side of highways that only accept cash. The sketchier the location, the better the tacos\n6. Kikes\n7. Birdcall\n\nIf I were you, I'd buy prepared food at a grocery store to save on some meals so I could splurge on others.",
      ">and a drink for an evening\n\nDrinks here are all super expensive in restaurants. Like $10 for a glass of house wine. There are definitely much better countries to drink in! My go-to is any unique cocktail or really weird thing I can't go pick up at the store right after.\n\nJust do yourself a favor and get most of your drinks from the store. You can afford much better stuff that way. Grab a bottle of wine/bourbon and some bubble bath \ud83d\udc4d\n\n$65 is fine but I would spend disporportionately if your company allows. Being under for a few days and then having $60-80 to put towards a nicer dinner with regional foods or cooks that are well known in the area makes a big difference in what you end up taking back about our food culture.",
      "I get $65 per diem. I eat hotel breakfast, get fast food for lunch at around $12. Then I have enough to get a good meal at a place like Texas Roadhouse or something decent local.  I've never really gotten close to $65.",
      "Brit here who used to live in America.\n\n#1 where you are makes a difference, Manhattan is not the same as rural Texas, and even in small towns there grabbing a burger at a local bar may cost more than you might think.\n\n#2 there is a culture difference to get used to, where many American folk expect to eat only half their meal, and box the rest as a meal for another day. In a bunch of places you have a choice if dishes that are 2 meals even if you aren't in a position to box, refrigerate and heat a second meal from your dinners even if you wanted to. That means aeal might be expensive if you consume it as a single meal, and ignore the rest\n\n#3 Fast food isn't always cheaper than going to a sit down place. If you're on a budget consider going to an Aldi or Trader Joe's and get a meal to heat. If you do for to a fast food place, eating in outside of major city centers can be really depressing as everyone bar tramps and societies vulnerable just pick up drive thrus.",
      "You should be ok for that budget. Hotel breakfast makes things easy, besides having breakfast you can always grab a couple of extra fruits, pastries or yogurts for snacking during the day or complement a meal ordered to your room with uber eats or something like that. I\u2019d save on the regular meals to spend on fancier ones from time to time, during the weekend or going out with colleagues. There are a lot of options for $20 to $30 a meal. I also love when I travel to check out grocery stores, local cheeses, cold cuts, breads, fruits, delis and prepared local food.",

      "The pizza in rome!! Can\u2019t quit thinking about it! \n\n\nI\u2019m going to japan next year I can\u2019t wait to fall in love with new food!",

      "Completely agree with your sentiments. I came to Japan for the sushi. Sure, the sushi was really good. But Fukuoka's tonkotsu ramen was mind-blowing and a quality I haven't been able to find replicated outside Japan.\n\nOther foods that've retained a similar hold on me:  \nPeking duck (Beijing)  \nFresh tortellini (Bologna)  \nJipijapa ceviche (Ecuador)  \nDolsot bibimbap (Jeonju)  \nBirria (Guadalajara)"

    "selftext": "I've been to 34 countries.\n\nMight sound silly, but for me the best experience was when we were starving in the Sierras in California. It was summer but it was freezing and raining. We arrived to our campsite, turned our stove on, grabbed some tortilla chips, nacho cheese and jalapenos and decided to make some nachos. Those warm, delicious nachos tasted better than anything I've ever tasted, and I still think about it today.\n\nThe gringas (similar to al pastor tacos) in Monterrey, MX in a neighborhood taco stand are a close second. So freaking good",

      "I had a wonderful evening on one of my solo travels in Italy in a little trattoria. The owners were so friendly and really liked to pamper me with their best food and drinks. There was no minute where I felt uncomfortable, just me, really great and simple food and nice people around me. I will never forget that",
      "I think Mexico and Italy have been my top 2 countries for food out of the \\~35 countries I've visited. I keep going back to Mexico for the food. Recently had some amazing meals in Oaxaca.",
      "If I had to pick one, it would be rendezvousing with 2 groups of friends in Bologna. We all had a bit of a harrowing journey to get there, but here we were. The first place we went to, directly after arrival, was a charcuterie restaurant that has very informal ordering prices. Through some language barrier we somehow ended up ordering a board that was 6 feet long, with many side plates. \n\nIt was basically a catering tray for a wedding of 20, for just the 6 of us. It was so massive that we ended up sharing with other people in the restaurant. \n\nThe wine was flowing, we were all so happy to see each other, the food was absolutely ridiculously good. \n\nIt is a core happy memory for me. I wish I could reach back and feel that way again. Pure joy is bottomless artisanal meats, bottles of wine, and talking shit to old friends you haven't seen in a while on the other side of the world.\n\n I could have died right there.",
      "We were in Santorini and walking around Fira and decided to have lunch overlooking the caldera. We weren\u2019t too familiar with Greek food so we asked the waiter/owner just to bring us some of his popular items. He kept bringing food till we could barely stand up and the bill was peanuts. Later in the day, we were walking by the same place and thought perhaps we\u2019d go to the same place and watch the sunset. All the tables at the railing were reserved so we sat farther back. He came out and saw us, and took the sign off the best table and ushered us over there. We drank lots of wine and had some snacks and at the end of it all, he not only refused to let us pay, but as it was the end of the season and he was closing for the winter, he emptied his fridge of all the pop and gave it to us.",
      "A little restaurant on a cliff right outside of Amalfi with a husband and wife owner/chef duo. It had glass windows all around for a panoramic view of the cliffs and water. My fianc\u00e9 and I were the only ones there most of the night, so it was essentially a private sunset dinner. Not sure why it was empty, because the food was good and the ingredients were super fresh farm to table from their garden and seafood caught locally that morning. They even called us a taxi home without having to even ask.",
      "Not food but drinks. I hiked Les Calanques back in October, it was a day with no clouds in sight, close to 30 degrees Celsius, and I went all the way up, all the way down to swim and to cool off, then all the way up and all the way down again to leave, swam again but I was still somehow completely drenched in sweat.\n\nWe sat in a restaurant by the port in Cassis and I ordered a passionfruit Gin and Tonic. It was the most delicious thing I have ever drank in my life and I think about it often ahahah.",

      "Spent a month backpacking solo around Ireland in October when I was 23, actually celebrated my 24th bday while I was there. Had one particularly rainy, chilly but wonderful day hiking around the west coast near Doolin, checking out the shore and looking for ring forts and towards the evening I went to a local pub for dinner. Had a bowl of seafood chowder and a basket of brown bread with good Irish butter, washed down with a couple pints of Guinness, while listening to a good seisun with local musicians. Pub had a fireplace burning turf. I can close my eyes and smell the fire and taste the soup. Absolutely glorious.",
      "A safari camp in Botswana.  Food driven in from three hours away on a super washboard gravel road in a safari 4x4 once per week.  Lots of locally grown food - sorghum based stuff.  Best part?  Chef is a local village lady who trained a little bit with a professional chef.  \n\nI swear to you the food deserved a Michelan star.  It was incredible.  The sauces, the cook on everything absolutely perfect, beautiful food and plating too.",
      "Was just recently in Vietnam, to visit my brother in law who was there for a month to teach English.  He had met a person on the plane over a few years ago when he did this and kept in contact.  That person also had to be in Vietnam at this time and invited us to visit the cathedral he was the architect on.  My brother in law had the wrong direction but we finally got there nearly two hours late.  They were holding a banquet for us and others, it was a Catholic seminary/monastery, it was unbelievable had several courses of traditional foods the whole thing was surreal.  There was goat, chicken with the feet, prawns, pork belly, an interesting soup. And yes it was an actual cathedral being built, but out of cement, looked like something out of Europe 300 years ago.",
      "1. Ko Lanta, Thailand. Kwan's Cookery. One of the best meals we have ever eaten. Still remember the amazing soft shell crab, grilled whole fish, and mango sticky rice. \n2. Zakynthos, Greece. Grill House Alexis. Hidden gem. No menu, they bring you everything, and you only pay 10\u20ac per person. And it's a massive amount of delicious food. Oh, and barbecue meats is thier specialty.",

      "Surprisingly, Amsterdam - my husband and I spent a very long (good!) day in the museumplein, visiting Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh, MoCo, and Stedelijk museums.  We were there from the Rijksmuseum opening in the morning until closing at Stedelijk, which was open late because it was a Friday.  Starving, we decided to head to Foodhallen and get whatever looked good for dinner.  I think we got food and drinks from five or six different stalls - a couple tacos and beer here, bitterballen, custard bao from the dumpling stand, more beer, an assortment of little desserts.  It was super crowded and we just grabbed countertops wherever we could find them.  By the end of it, we were kinda drunk and grossly full.  Was the food the best we've ever had?  No.  But that experience, just the two of us darting around in the crowds drinking and eating whatever we felt like, getting tipsy after a long day of exploring museums, was sooooo so much fun.\n\nActually, looking back at our food/travel crossovers, a lot of my favorite food experiences don't necessarily highlight the best meals of my life.",
      "I\u2019m old!!! So mine date back over 40 years so that makes these truly memorable. \n\nFirst time I had proper Indian chai/masala tea brewed in a samovar in Mussorie in the foothills of the himilaya\u2019s in 1988\n\nButter chicken and naan in the back streets of Mumbai (literally on the street - and that\u2019s all they served) - 2000\n\nIn 2020 I finally got a bucket list item of a backwaters cruise in Kerala \u2026 just the two of us, and three staff including the most incredible chef. We were feed the most delicious Keralan food \u2026 fresh seafood and delicious curries \u2026 totally blown away. \n\nKokoda \u2026 raw fish similar to ceviche \u2026 in Fiji 1987\n\nBanana roti pancakes on the streets of Phuket \n\nFresh baked brownie pie from the Pie Lady of Pie Town New Mexico \u2026 we were riding a Harley from Orlando to LA and stumbled across this wonderful place \u2026 she even gave me the recipe \n\nFrito pie in Galveston \u2026 same trip \n\nGerman potato soup on the border of Germany and Switzerland in a small hotel",
      "Did a life changing trip to Greece.  The food there is just incredible and world class in its own right.  Mostly because of the freshness and simplicity.  But one experience stands out.\n\nWe chartered a sail boat for our group, about 50/50 tourists and locals (a friend of ours splits time between Greece and NYC and it was a mix of both his friend groups), hit a few private beaches, a ship wreck, and a good local fishing spot.  We had a band come out with us and they were playing just 3 string instruments and singing.  We had basically as much local bear, wine, and ouzo as we could drink, and about gallon freezer bag of weed from a friend\u2019s family\u2019s farm.  The captain was a chef too and was cooking anything and everything we caught basically the second we pulled it out of the water.\n\nWe anchored at a spot and one of the locals showed me how to free dive and pry the sea urchins off the rocks.  We brought back a small bag of them to the chef, and went back down for round two.  And then it happened\u2026\n\nI came back out of the water at the ladder, with a full bag in hand, my now wife and her friends partying in bikinis at the end of the ship, the band playing and singing, the ocean breeze and the salt from the Aegean wiping\u2026 and standing over me was the chef / captain with the shucked open sea urchin and a bottle of ouzo\u2026 he bent over and said \u201cthe first ones for you brother\u201d and held up the bottle and nodded his head, I got a mouth full of ouzo, salt water, and fresh sea urchin, and it is to this day the greatest bite, the greatest moment of my life.",
      "I think my top would be a food tour we did in Chiang Mai (Thailand).  I was on a trip with 9 other women.  We had a local guide and we drove around in a songthaew to a number of stops.  She told us at the beginning that we'd be having 26 courses so to pace ourselves.  The food was fantastic.  Pretty much every stop was a place for locals, not aimed at the tourist market.  My favorite was a place that cooks pork belly inside large clay pots that used to be used for water storage but got repurposed when city water supply became widely available.  \n\nWe did a similar tour in Bangkok which was equally fun and tasty - on this one we went by tuk tuks and it was more a hybrid food/ see the sites at night tour whereas the Chiang Mai one really was all about the food.",
      "Sounds so silly, but I loved the food in Ireland. I don't mean one dish either. The quality of the food overall was amazing. It is sooo much fresher than where I'm from.

      "North Coast of California, abalone diving and was camping with a large group.  They built an absolute \\*feast\\*.  Someone brought an outdoor kitchen setup and prepared squid eyes to initiate the newbies, but made them so well, that even the fear factor garlic butter squid eyes were amazing.  Spent the evening pounding the abs (abalone is quite tough), which were then tempura fried.  Another diver with us had shot a six foot ling cod and made nuggets out of it.  Another member had brought ribs to cook over the fire.  Even the two kids someone brought along with them spent their day picking mussels off the rocks, and cooked them up too.\n\nIt was an absolute feast, and some of the best food I've ever had.",

After a few hours traversing through the watery jungle, we made our way back to land. We drove a ways down the trail and then stopped to have lunch at this little ramshackle open-air hut covered in woven palm leaves and the guys there served us the best blackened fish I have ever eaten, with fried plantains, sambhar, some other foods, all served on a banana leaf, eating with our hands, and it felt like a feast. We finished the meal with a refreshing buttermilk (or yogurt) drink in a clay cups. It was just so delicious. The setting, the adventure, the feeling of being there really added to it.",

      "Ate at a small restaurant off the Spanish steps in Rome.  There was an accordion player busking nearby, the food was great.  We saw person after person passing with little boxes of something and plastic spoons.  It became a steady stream.  After dinner, we followed the stream to a little store that specialized in tiramisu to go in little boxes, all different flavors.  We joined the parade and were in heaven.",

Someone came up to me and said \u201cYou can\u2019t eat by yourself!\u201d and invited me to sit and share dinner with them and their party. They were surfers, and were so excited to meet a surfer from California. The food was amazing, but the hospitality I experienced in Taiwan was something else. Culturally the two are very intertwined.",
      "Experience? Maybe a cooking class in Laos where we got ingredients at a local market and made spring rolls, stuffed lemongrass, coconut curry chicken, and mango sticky rice. Just a lovely experience from start to finish.\n\nBest food? Definitely Mexico; from octopus tacos to mushroom quesadillas to lamb ravioli and tuna cannelloni tapas.\n\nHonorable mention: not really on vacation but I taught English at a school in China and sometimes the school would wine and dine us with some incredibly lavish banquet dinners put on by either students\u2019 families or local associations. Food was always top notch.",
      "Random Hawker Centres in Singapore. Just amazing. Want Malay? Fine. Want Chinese, sure. Want Indian?-yup we got it. Want it all together? Sure.

It was probably the best meal I\u2019ve ever had",
      "Paris: tomato & mozzarella sandwich on newly baked bread, from the cafe at the top of the Eiffel tower. It was drizzling a cold rain in March and the sandwich ingredients were so fresh & perfect. Sounds ridiculously touristy but it was simple, delicious, and very memorable.\n\nBarcelona: a traditional seafood paella in a family-owned restaurant somewhere around Santa Maria del Mar. It was perfect.\n\nUSA: a horchata popsicle in old town Scottsdale, AZ.  I don\u2019t ever crave ice cream but still think about that popsicle.",
      "I had spent the morning at Macba, Universitat, and Paralel skateboarding in Barcelona with some friends and we made our way down towards the beach and saw a small place down an alley.

The cava was amazing and the bocadillos were perfect standing food and it was just such a warm place and experience. Perfect little watering hole.\n\nXampanyeria/Can Paixano if you are looking for it.\n\nHad a similar experience with wine and paninis at I Fratellini in Florence.",

      "My husband got a recommendation from a fellow Western traveler in Osaka, who got his recommendation from a salary man for a quiet sushi place. I never understood the sex to food comparison until I ate this sushi. It was so divine, I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone after dinner. Just walk and digest in silence.",

The meals included a half bottle of wine, an appetizer, entree, salad, and cheese or dessert. The food was exquisite, every single element. I never knew roast chicken could be rhapsodically delicious. A chef friend basically said that the fantastic flavor was due to French butter, which also explains the incredible croissants and pastries.",
      "I was traveling in Spain and had a little romantic fling with a local.  He took me to Cadeques.  We went into a little shop and picked up picnic foods.

Those simple sandwiches are one of my favorite food memories.",

      "2014 in Istanbul, I was a HS junior at the time. Bit of a story.\n\nMy dad and I initially wanted to go to India, but my travel visa for India didn't arrive in time, so we picked a place on that side of the world which ended up being Turkey.\n\nAnybody who's visited Istanbul can tell you about the eager carpet salesmen, and the amazing presentation while serving you tea of your choice. My favorite is jasmine.\n\nWell, there was this one particular shop that we visited who's owner showed us the entire shebang. The carpet showroom, the carpet repair floor, the roof, etc. Quaint little place right next to the Blue Mosque. Super friendly people. And some of these carpets are GORGEOUS. We're talking silk that turns different colors depending on the angle, and softer than something, like, SUPER soft. A carpet you're going to hang up on the wall.\n\nThe owner, Bob, and his associate, Rob, told us they'd like to take us to dinner. Now keep in mind we spent quote a deal of time at the carpet shop just chatting, drinking tea and having a good time. We were apprehensive of course. Different country, we don't really know anything, etc. Despite all this, we figured why not. Worst that can happen is we're kidnapped.\n\nSo we get into a car driven by a friend of Bob's who Bob also invited to dinner. We're making our way through the maze of streets in Istanbul just BARELY avoiding other cars that are 3 wide on a 2 wide road. No idea how they do it. ANYWAY, my dad keeps giving me this wide-eyed, \"what the hell did we get into,\" glance. I start feeling the same.\n\nThe car comes to a stop in front of an unassuming store front with two shady looking fellas in front. I thought, and I'm sure my dad did too, that this must be it. We're going to be kidnapped and be on the evening news. Navy SEALs will be dispatched in a week. Bob leads us into the store which ends up being a sort of grocery store/restaurant iirc. He keeps leading us to the back and all of a sudden it's this VIP looking room that's essentially the Turkish version of Goodfellas or mob stuff.\n\nWhat followed was the most interesting, and amazing dining experience of my life even more than 10 years later. I don't know how many courses of food were brought out. Some sort of tomato sauce in a lettuce leaf, different meats, kebabs, etc. Then there was the Kurdish coffee. Holy S\\*\\*T. I haven't any coffee that can hold a candle to that. Rich, creamy, light, all at the same time. Bob, Rob, and their friend Steve were incredibly friendly and hospitable the whole night.\n\nAfter a few hours of dining and socializing, the check came. That was our next \"uh oh,\" as my dad thought they might try to spring the whole bill on us. Nope. Bob covered it. Then he had his friend Steve take us back to our hotel, although we asked that he just take us nearby.\n\nOverall, it was a life changing experience. Some people out there are truly kind and genuine, and being someone who spent their early life in the Midwest, it helped me shape my view of others and how I see them even today in a positive way. Be kind, and be genuine. My dad stayed in touch with Rob who we ended up hosting at our home in the states too. It was great to see a friend from another part of the world, and get to return the favor.",

      "I'm a vegetarian. My cousin in Thailand took me to this little corner of Bangkok with stalls that served only vegetarian Thai food. The absolute best vegetarian food I've ever had. I always go there when I visit Bangkok.",
      "France and Italy travels have had the best food ever.  The freshness and the flavors are just so good.",
      "That\u2019s a hard one but I\u2019d say a Japanese Kaiseki dinner in Kyoto.  Not only was the food unique and extraordinary but the venue was a 500 year old building surrounded by gardens that were spectacular.  Very memorable.",
      "That is valid, Mexican food is top tier. I think my favorite food so far (I think I have been to about 9 countries now) is from the Hunan Province in China. I stayed at a friend's house, and everything her mom made was so delicious, so I really ate like a local. I adore spicy food, so I am so bias because everything there is adorned in spices and chili peppers. Spicy pork with chopped chilis on a bed of rice, with some hot jasmine tea, add some more chopped fermented chilis... absolute perfection.",
      "Charleston, SC...every place everything! Best foodie experience of my life!",
      "Hands down, Sicily. Most amazing food I have ever eaten in my two weeks all over that island.",
      "Lima, Peru! Food is flavorful and delicious from street cart to posh venues. No surprise the top restaurant in the world is in Peru.",
      "Road tripping through Baja California.  Stopped for food at the first spot I found on the side of the road, I was super hungry.  Wound up being the best culinary experience of my life.  \nNothing ground breaking.  Just fresh tortillas, cheese, eggs and plenty of farm cats and goats.",
      "I really enjoyed the food in European truck stops.  Oh so good.",
      "Grilled chicken thigh and rice from a food truck my nose lead me to in Tokyo. Not in a major tourist part of the city I was visiting a fountain pen shop. Smelled heaven and found where all the local business people and students were ordering from. Ordered it up and found a quiet bench to sit on.  It was great.",
      "Every meal I ate in Vietnam.  From the cheaper street food and streetside table restaurants to the higher end fancy places.\nEven the food on the train was delicious.",
      "Food experiences I find tend to fall in two categories\u2014 repeatable vs singular moments in time. Repeatable are those that, as it says, are capable of replication by someone else\u2014 top restaurants, an amazing hole in the wall, food tour, treats found at a local spot, etc. Those tend to be more about the food itself. The singular moments in time are those that stand out because of the circumstances of enjoying it gave the food an extra layer of perfection. The kind of experience where if you tried to create the dish outside of that environment, you\u2019d be disappointed and wonder why you thought it was so great. \n\nSo with that in mind:\n- Repeatable\u2014 the Club Tengo Hambre daycation we took thought Valle de Guadalupe wine country. And actual Kobe beef we had at a Pontocho restaurant in Kyoto.\n\n- Moment in time\u2014 the plate of cold freshly made soba noodles at a small one-man shop along the Philosophers Path in Kyoto. We were there for our honeymoon during a deadly heat wave, but were trying to make the best of it. The noodles were very basic, but ice cold and delicious, and the proprietor so kind. We still 6 years later talk about how wonderful that meal was.",
      "Just got back from a euro trip. So a bit more to add then just the states. \n\nParis, France - the French don\u2019t fuck around. Didn\u2019t have a bad meal where ever I went. Pizza, snails, macaroons, croissants, wine for dayssss.  You name it, GOOD! \nPrague, Czech Republic - Wow, everything was GOOD! Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have the best burger I\u2019ve ate outside of the states. Also had FANTASTIC Georgian food. More of a melting pot for European countries rather than the traditional. And #1 fave place for beer. \n\nRome, Italy - Gotta escape the tourist traps on your left and right. But when you do, very solid. Obviously Amazing pizza and Pasta, however starts to feel like everywhere you go is the same menu. Although they also have GREAT sandwich spots.",
      "I had the best Thai food of my life (and I\u2019ve been to Thailand) in Sheringham, UK. It was AMAZING. My husband and I still talk about it. But\u2026 probably because we\u2019d spent the past month eating British food and were happy to have some flavor.",
      "\u014cx in Reykjavik, Iceland. It is definitely one of those upscale Michelin starred restaurants, but the experience was so incredible. The food was out of this world - traditional Icelandic bites like rye bread cooked in a milk carton in geothermal waters, the freshest fish I\u2019ve ever had, a full alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink pairing, and some really fun experimental things like a chicken skin cookie. The atmosphere was so neat, the chef quite literally made it a replica of his grandmother\u2019s house, including using her old kitchen cabinets in the dining room. It was almost like an \u201comakase\u201d setup where the chef\u2019s prepare in front of you and tell stories and talk to you while they cook and plate. Highly recommend it. \n\nAside from that - all the food in Iceland. We adored it. Licorice ice cream and 3 \u00deristur candy bars. The best fresh baked vanilla rolls. THE HOT DOGS WITH B\u00c9CHAMEL AND FRENCH FRIED ONIONS - OH MY GOD THOSE HOT DOGS!!! Everyday I wake up upset that I\u2019m not in Iceland.",
      "Indonesia. It was on a planned trip but we went to a bunch of restaurants that did the best seafood I'd ever eaten. Everytime we went to a place that did seafood I knew it was going to be a 10/10.",
      "Here\u2019s what comes to mind for me: \n\nRome, Italy - I had the most amazing beef tartare at a restaurant called Benso. My brother and I still talk about that dish often lol \n\nVernazza, Italy - Somebody recommended that we try a particular foccaceria in town. I wasn\u2019t really hungry but I thought sure, I\u2019ll just grab two and share it with my parents and husband, we\u2019ll each tear off a bit just to have a taste. I took one bite of that soft, pillowy, salty, pesto-y bread of the gods and I was like \u201coh hell naw, I can\u2019t share this!\u201d I told my parents to get their own because I was definitely eating the whole thing by myself. That was probably the best bread I\u2019ve ever had in my entire life. (I also went back and bought another one an hour later) \n\nBangkok, Thailand - not me, but my husband. We had just gotten out of the train station after a long, hot day at an elephant sanctuary. We were tired and starving. We hit up the nearest pad thai street vendor and when my husband took that first bite, his eyes practically rolled back in his head lol. (I liked it too, I just didn\u2019t have the same reaction as him) To this day, whenever someone asks him what his favourite food is, he says pad thai and tells them about that meal.",
      "Hard to tell. But once I was in Koh Tao, a small island in the gulf of Thailand, swimming at a small white sand beach alone and surrounded only by nature and feeling incredible\u2026 but hungry, and I didn\u2019t know the island that well at the time so I was planning to get out  of the water, take my rental scooter and try to find somewhere nice for lunch, when out of nowhere I see a hawker coming towards me with somtum (spicy papaya salad), sticky rice and grilled home grown chicken\u2026 THAT was the top culinary experience of my life, not just because the food tasted like Dua Lipa french kissing me passionately but also because of the impecable timing that angel showed up to cook for me on the spot and the glorious scene that I was at. It was like God wanted me to know that he was there, and everything was gonna be fine. How much I paid for my food you say? 4 bucks tip included. I still think about that that some times and it was around 7 years ago\u2026",
      "I must have had a few thousand food experiences while traveling\u2026no way I\u2019d be able to choose a best.\n\nI\u2019m going to guess the best overall food experience has been Thailand, without the single best experience necessarily being there.  Lots of good food in Mexico too.  And France.  And many other places.  Had one experience that stands out in Japan\u2026\n\nThe one that comes to mind right now was the Ovocn\u00e9 Knedl\u00edky near the Prague Zoo, across the street from the Troja palace.",
      "My friend\u2019s family in Spain fed us sooooo well. It\u2019s been 21 years and I still think about all that delicious food.",
      "Greece, specifically Chania, Crete. Seaside seafood, fresh vegetables. Amazing!",
      "There have been many fantastic moments but I'll always remember one time when I was just 14 yrs. old. I was at the national scout ranch in NM and embarked on a 10 day hike where we took all our dehydrated food with us. At the end we were given a demonstration of dutch oven cooking which consisted of corned beef hash and peach cobbler. Nothing ever tasted so damn good in my life. And so I realized that the appreciation of food is relative to how starved for it you are.",

      "The travel food memory I savour most is a perfect tree-ripened mango falling to the ground near us as we were walking a footpath on Little Corn Island, Nicaragua. Ate it with my husband and son as we stood under a shady tree. \n\nThere used to be a man who\u2019d stroll the West Bay beach in Roatan, Honduras hawking his wife\u2019s freshly made banana donuts. Man, were those were incredible.",
      "Thailand & Vietnam. Quite possibly the healthiest, heavilyspiced,  flavor intensive foods.",
      "Olives in Morocco. They taste like sunshine. They even served them for breakfast \nThai food in Thailand. My first night there. The bellhop put me in a taxi with a driver who spoke no English.  He dropped me off at a place with a large sign that said Seafood Restaurant in English. You go into the first room and pick out your fish live from about 20 aquariums. Then you get seated and they bring you your really fresh seafood cooked to perfection. The hostess insisted that she sit with me because woman traveling alone. I learn a lot from her about Bangkok and what to see. The taxi was waiting for me when I came out.",
      "After 49 countries, the most delicious food I've ever had are the ones that are homemade in the most random places. Breakfast is Jaffna Dosa with coconut Sambol in a farming village in Habarana, Sri Lanka. For lunch, it was some mashed eggplant with olive oil and yogurt sauce (I don't know the name, unfortunately) in Lahich, Azerbaijan. And for dinner, the best pesto gnocchi I've ever had in Ventimiglia, Italy.",

      "Mexico City, just walking around and this cute cafe called out to us.  The waiter was super friendly and accommodating so when he suggested the enchiladas verdes I was all about it.  Oh man, soooo good and so cheap, I think it was $4.50 for a big meal.\n\nThen there was this '50s style burger joint, I've been chasing a burger high ever since then.  The staff were all so happy and friendly too.\n\nReally, the only bad meal we had in 10 days was at this place that looked like a Mexican Denny's, can't remember the name but DO NOT order the pasta.       \nNo.  Bad dog!  Do not do!      \nWe should have known when the place was full of old white folks but after a week of Mexican food we just wanted something basic and \"Northern\".",

Not only was the food delicious, but I got to experience it with my best friends when we traveled through SE Asia after college graduation. \n\nIf I continue on my current career path, I will probably not have an opportunity to take a 5 week sabbatical in order to travel the world for at least another 15 years. Perhaps it\u2019s time I pick up travel blogging\u2026.",
      "I was in an island called Pulau Lanjukang in Indonesia about 6-7 years ago, where it took a few hours by a random local fishing boat from Makassar to get there. I had always been so fascinated with the idea of going there (heard there were only 50 villagers in total living there) so my late husband and I decided to go (along with my besties and my late husband\u2019s parents). I had to negotiate with the fisherman (I can speak the language) if he wanted to make some extra money. He said okay. \n\nWhen we got finally there, there was no restaurants or anything, as expected and what a bliss it was! But we weren\u2019t as prepared with food. Poor planning on our part. Our companions were getting hungry. So I asked a villager if he had caught any fish for the day and if he would like to sell them. He said he caught around 10 of them. I said I\u2019d buy them all. I asked again if he would be able to grill them as well at extra charge. He said yes. So then he began to start a makeshift grill station at his backyard, and grill the fish. Meanwhile, I didn\u2019t know that his wife was at home making coffee and tea and cooking rice. They even let us eat at their verandah. Their generosity and hospitality were unmatched. We talked a bit (mostly me and the locals and then I translated for the rest of my family and friends) and it was such an insightful view of their lives. I brought over some candies from my country to share with the village kids and they were so happy as well. And the cost of the lunch for 7 people including our fisherman captain? Just $25 (300k rupiah). It was a food experience that I\u2019ll never forget in my life. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/o8rPXLn.jpeg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bT48Sfn.jpeg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/SEhIxmQ.jpeg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kwyq0QE.jpeg",

      "On my honeymoon, we kayaked over to Railay Beach, Thailand.  We decided to stop for ice cream.  Then we saw and smelled everyone else's food and decided to get an actual meal.  I had massaman curry and I think my wife had green curry.  It was so fucking good (even for Thai standards) that we literally had to stop talking to each other because talking was distracting from how good the food was.",
      "I love how all of these are not as much about the food but the precious, precious memories.\n\nMine would be the little pears we bought on a market on the Seychelles. We used to hike in unbelievabe heat to watch even more unbelievable views from above. We used to drive along the shoreline, stopping at random places and climb up the huge rocks that were scattered along the beaches. Sitting on top of the rocks, we would eat the juicy pears and get splattered with drops of sea water from the waves crashing against volcanic rock below us. Pure paradise.",

      "Coolest experience:\nStayed at a 5-star in Colmar with points we accumulated. A 2-star Michelin restaurant was located in the lobby of the hotel. We made a reservation and dressed up as nice as we could but ultimately we looked way out of place. But the service was top tier, the food was perfect, and the ambience was calming. I don't even know what we ate but it tasted great.\u00a0\n\n\nMost fulfilling experience:\nLived in Chiapas, Mexico for 8 months eating very simple food. Went to visit my family in Chihuahua and we stopped to get some road side burritos and gorditas and I almost started crying.",

      "I hiked through Colca Canyon in Peru on a 3 day trek. It was honestly really amazing and I highly recommend anyone to go there. The last day's hike was back up the canyon and it was pretty tough. I've done a lot of hikes including the Inca Trail via Dead Woman's Pass at 4000 meters but for some reason this hike out of the canyon was really hard.\n\nWaiting for us at the top was a small group of local women selling food and supplies. One was selling Snickers bars. At the time, that Snickers bar was fucking amazing.\n\nThe other food experience that sticks out is when I went to Costa Rica. We went to a restaurant in San Jose where they did a multi-course \"food tour\" of Costa Rica. It was fabulous.",
      "We\u2019re driving in the middle of the day on the coast of the Peloponnese, Greece and we stopped on the side of the road at this restaurant that was on a cliff over looking the Aegean Sea.

His love and passion for his food I was in awe, and because we were obviously amazed at his cooking he thrived off that. He didn\u2019t charge us for any of the food we didn\u2019t order he was just so happy to keep feeding us and for us to try new things, when we tried to tip him more he refused to accept anything more than what we ordered. \n\nHe brought out fish he just caught that day and cooked, salads, a baked dish and deserts. He was explaining to us his food, how he cooks it and all, and we were just eating it all up, the love and passion was oozing. It was just the cutest and most hospitality little Greek papou with the most amazing fresh produce and simple but amazing tasting food, with so much love for feeding people.",

      "I make it a point to do a food tour in any new country I visit. Singapore was definitely the best. Labyrinth was a superb Michelin restaurant, Singaporean themed and I loved doing a couple of Hawker Centre food tours too. \nDani Garcia\u2019s restaurant in Marbella, Spain (3 Michelin stars and now very sadly closed) overall was the best meal I have ever had when travelling.",
      "One of the best food experiences I\u2019ve had is dining at StreetXO in Madrid. It was a 2hr wait to get in but unlike anything else and totally worth it. \n\nFood and drinks were fantastic and while still kind of pricey, you get the Michelin level food from the same star chef for much cheaper than its 3 Michelin star sister restaurant, DiverXO.",
      "Morocco surprised me with their food. Tagine is the best!",
      "Some of my best travel memories are with food and have been lucky to travel a good bit. Some that stand out. \n\n1) Was lucky to have a french friend in Paris that I met from living in Japan, she showed us all around the city and took us to great local patisseries and sandwich shops. She found us a great affordable french place pretty close to the Moulin Rouge for dinner where we had cheeses, wines, bread, escargot, and steak tar tar with pomme frites. Was particularly serendipitous because I was traveling with my high school best friend backpacking, with my good french friend I met from living in Osaka, and she brought several beautiful female friends with her, and on top of that one of my good friends who I knew from living in Charlotte happened to have been working a flight to Paris as a flight attendant. Was great to have so many unique friends in one spot together for a lovely long french dinner. We had a lot of fun that night too going out to bars and a club.\n\n2) Peak restaurant in NYC was an amazing experience. Good refined food and not crazy crazy expensive for lunch considering the amazing view of the Manhattan skyline. Not too far away from where I live, but was an awesome way to celebrate getting the Covid vaccine with my now wife and start traveling again. I have so many great food memories around NYC from the great Italian spots, the hot pot or food court in the New World Mall in Flushing Queens, to the great refined Japanese, french, and American places in Midtown, the fun and creative food at Smorgasburg, to the Korean BBQ in K-town, the fushkas and thai food in Jackson Heights in Queens, to the late night pizza, bodega bacon and cheese on a bagel sandwiches and Halal carts of the city. Being closeish to NYC and being a foodie is a dream come true. You can really find a good authentic version of any food here!\n\n3) So many great nights making friends, dating, and drinking in the Izakayas of Osaka Japan when I lived there. Was a great way to start the night with friends before exploring the endless bars and clubs around Namba. I was lucky to have a Japanese grandma who would amazing homemade delicious feasts for me when I was a student as a homestay and when I'd visit when I lived there after. Was also really cool there was a seafood market that would open at 5 AM near my ex's place in Sakai that was great for a bowl of fresh tempura, sashimi, or grilled fish after drinking and taking the first train home in the morning. \n\n4) Always feels like home going back to California and going to In-n-Out as well as a good taco truck/ abuela run mexican restaurant. \n\n5) After getting engaged at the Grand Canyon, my now wife and I celebrated by going all out on the Vegas strip for a couple days and got some of the best seats at restaurants like Hells Kitchen, Momofuku, Wing Lei, Sushisamba, the Bacchanal buffet etc. \n\n6) So many great late night eats around the world like my first Donner Kebab and Currywurst in Berlin, late night Ramen in Japan, Taiwanese fried chicken at the night markets in Taipei, tacos in Mexico, my first real poutine in Montreal, a late night dinner of cubano, pork with beans and rice and mojitos at Versailles in Miami.\n\n7) Eating spaetzle at the Paradis Hutte in Pontresina Switzerland. You have to hike there or can take a lift partially up and it's a classic Swiss hut restaurant with the most beautiful view of a glacier and the Swiss alps. Hard to beat on a perfect summer day outside. \n\n8) The rusty Pelican in Miami is an incredible restaurant, beautiful views of Miami on a key connected to other keys by causeway that have beautiful beaches. Some of the best seafood I've ever had and great cocktails with great use of tropical ingredients. \n\n9) Eating a bush dinner with the Maasai tribe in the Maasai Mara, Kenya. Was a unique cultural experience to dance and chant with them before eating so much delicious meat out in the savannah. We even saw a hippo really close to where we were eating our dinner when driving back \n\n10) Some others: Eating Carolina BBQ in a random little holler off the Blue Ridge Parkway near Asheville, NC which had a country singer outside, fantastic ribs and pulled pork. The seafood shacks off the coast of cape cod. Eating your way through a Thai street market in Bangkok, especially the Kra pow kai dow, papaya salad, and mango sticky rice or going to the boat noodle alley. Eating Korean BBQ in Seoul. Eating a snack and having a drink at the iron door saloon in Groveland, CA; it's exactly what you imagine an old school western saloon to be and I think is the oldest in California. Having a real middle eastern spread of Kebabs, bread, hummus, a date milkshake, biryani etc. in the old section of Dubai near the fort. Eating real Kobe Wagyu beef in a top end steakhouse in Kanazawa Japan that had a beautiful view of the Japanese Alps. Eating Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza in a high rise hotel room in Chicago. The Chinese street food in Hong Kong was amazing. Eating all the cajun and creole classics in New Orleans when on my bachelor party like aligator, gumbo, shrimp/ catfish po boys, pate, fried chicken, etc. Nothing quite like a seaside fish and chips at an English pub in Cornwall. Some of the home made meals in Western Michigan from the fresh produce, really big asparagus, fresh fish from Lake Michigan, homemade cherry pies from fresh cherries off the tree, etc. Eating buffalo and elk at a steakhouse in Colorado Springs CO, lots of great breweries and brewery food too in CO. Eating proper dim sum in Guanzhou China. Eating at Mom's spaghetti in Detroit (Eminem's spaghetti restaurant) for the novelty. The pho and bun cha amongst others in Hanoi is excellent; went to the bun cha restaurant where Obama and Anthony Bourdain ate. Getting a classic Philly cheese steak in Philadelphia. Had some amazing pork at a little place in Ubud in Bali Indonesia. The Khmer noodles with a view of the old Angkor ruins in Cambodia was incredible. Had a fantastic meal of moose meatballs in a lovely square in Stockholm with my family. Having Schnitzel with potato salad outdoors in the summer in Berlin or Sausages in Regensburg.",
      "All of it!! Every country I have gone to has had fantastic food! I couldn\u2019t even try to decide which is best.",
      "Never imagined I'd see Monterrey mentioned here! Sweet\n\nAnd yeah, hunger is the best seasoning. In training for SERE-equivalent situations, I used to go 100h + without food a few times. I still remember the first meal I had the first time I did it. I felt I was in communion with the 33 chilean miners jajajaj",
      "For me it was this popular Mexican restaurant called \"Mi casa\" in Breckenridge, Colorado. The food there is awesome, and the views are pretty great. Nothing taste as awesome as warm tacos after a day of skiing. Add to this Dillon Dam Brewery for the vibes and the view. Just fucking gorgeous.",
      "I was cycling through Patagonia and it was hard to eat enough. I stayed overnight at a hospedaje in Futaleuf\u00fa, Chile, and the woman who owned it was an amazing cook. She made this incredible peach custard pie for breakfast. It was like 2\" tall and I ate half of it for my breakfast. I wish I had asked for a recipe or been able to recreate it, but I still have dreams about it 15 years later.\n\nThe second best was on the same trip, I stopped for lunch at a place run by an Argentine couple outside of PN Los Alerces. They had homemade bread, fresh eggs, homemade jams and jellies, homemade apple cider, garden-fresh vegetables, it was all so unbelievably good and fresh. There was no fixed menu and they kept offering things and I kept eating all of the delicious foods. There is something really special about really good food when you're really hungry.",
      "I've only been to about 6 countries in my teens where I remember what I ate...\n\nI was on a class trip to Barcelona where my best friend and I shared the national dish of Spain (Rice Paella). I was pretty negative towards it when I saw it on the menu, but it said it was only 20\u20ac and we thought it was a steal and you HAD to be 2 people to order it so we thought 'why not?' However, it was 20\u20ac per person which was made unclear on the menu.\n\nAfter a disappointment of the price, we didn't back down and ordered it. It is an intriguing pan dish with rice, vegetables, and (seafood) - Which I realised later is a large controversy since it wasn't originally made with shrimp. The taste of the Paella was pretty amazing at the restaurant, and the experience was combined with the taste and the thought of experiencing culture. The waiter applauded me and my friend for ordering it because it is not necessarily ordered by two Norwegian 17-year-olds.  \n\nIt was surely an important memory of the trip, and the experience alone has inspired me to travel across the world to have a taste of culture, and food and create amazing memories. \n\n(I found out later that my friend hated the dish, and thought it was.. well not appetising).",
      "My family took a trip to Germany 2008 to meet my sister's new husband's family. They lived in a small (like 100 people) village near the Polenz River and for such a small community, I had some of the best food of my life.  They had a 'bowling alley' where the pins were on ropes so you could reset it from the end of the lane and the ball was about the size of a bocce ball. Anyway, there we watched Germany win their match against Portugal in the Euro Cup and after the match we ate J\u00e4gerschnitzel with veggies grown by a neighbor and since we were the guests of honor, had all the German beer and schnapps we could drink. My BIL's grandpa drank my dad under the table (he fancied himself a guy who could handle \"a German-worthy amount\" when in it came to alcohol, but not a chance) and I had a complete blast. The next day his mom spent all day cooking a Goulash over an open fire in what I can only declscribe as a witch's cauldron. 2 of the best meals I've ever had. \n\nVisiting Lisbon and Porto last year was another best meal. We went to Ponto Final on our last night and had some of the best seafood of our whole trip, including gigantic prawns and monkfish soup, then took a water taxi across the river. That boat ride will live forever in the top 10 best experiences I've had traveling.",
      "Eating non-US food again after being out there for 2 months. \n\nI swear my digestive system still hasn't fully recovered, even 9 months later.",
      "Street food in Korea dude like holy shit I ate my way through Seoul and the price tho varied was totally worth it!",
      "South africa no question, steak is perfect everywhere and crazy cheap, all food is so well made and delicious, their cuisine is not bland they use sauces salsa and everything \nDefo would go back just for the food",
      "When I was 19 I flew to California to meet up with one of my best friends who was at university there, we travelled to Mexico for a couple weeks, then across the south and up the east coast to Canada in a VW van.  In one of the towns on the coast in Baja I had a chicken torta from food truck - life changing.  Not sure why but it was one of the most delicious things I ever had.  If it wasn\u2019t so filling I would have eaten 5.",
      "I\u2019ve been to 40 countries- and the cities where i had the best food are - lima, everywhere in lebanon, and ho chi minh. But the best experience was in India, because I didn\u2019t expect to love Indian food. I had indian food 2x and had decided, nope it was not for me. My mind changed when i went there and just gave it another chance. I ate from fine dine to local restaurant to street food. We had 2 street food tours in Delhi and 1 in Jaipur. I really fell in love with the spices, flavor, techniques.. etc. i came prepared though, I brought zithromax, zofran and packets of pedialyte, and just accepted the possibility of food poisoning! Thank God i didn\u2019t have to use them",
      "I'm not as seasoned a traveller as you \u2013\u00a017 countries so far \u2013\u00a0but my favourite by a long shot was Marbella (fish market & raw bar & grill) in Cancun. It's not in the touristy hotel district but to the north, in a quieter area that seemed more popular with Mexican people rather than foreigners. Hands down the best seafood I've ever had. Margharitas the size of my skull. Excellent service. We'd sit there and watch the fishing boats come in with freshly caught seafood. The fish tacos there were incredible but the grilled octopus was my favourite. Never forget that place \u2013 we went back every night for a week.\n\nSecond favourite was Greetje in Amsterdam which sadly closed a few years back (I think)",
      "Experiencing Japanese food is like embarking on a culinary journey that blends tradition, precision, and aesthetic beauty. Here's a vivid description of what it's like:\n\nImagine stepping into a cozy izakaya or a serene sushi bar in Japan. The atmosphere is serene, with soft lighting and a minimalist decor that highlights the artistry of the cuisine. The first thing that strikes you is the meticulous presentation of each dish. Whether it's a delicate sashimi platter arranged like a vibrant bouquet or a bowl of ramen adorned with perfectly sliced green onions and tender slices of pork, every detail reflects a deep respect for ingredients and aesthetics.\n\nThe flavors are equally captivating. Take a bite of sushi, and you taste the freshness of the fish, the subtle sweetness of the rice, and the hint of wasabi that tingles your palate. Each dish is crafted to balance flavors \u2013 from the umami richness of miso soup to the savory depth of grilled yakitori skewers. Even simple dishes like tempura or udon noodles surprise you with their depth of flavor and texture.\n\nJapanese food isn't just about taste; it's a sensory experience. The textures range from crisp tempura batter to silky tofu, satisfying your senses with each bite. The aromas of dashi broth simmering on the stove or the smoky fragrance of grilled seafood evoke a sense of comfort and warmth.",
      "That\u2019s amazing survival food. I\u2019ll keep that in mind for when I go hiking.",
      "I've been to 48/50 states and 15 countries\n\n1. Italy\nHad a Florentine steak in Siena that blew my mind.  I also had some incredible Osso Bucco in Florence and Saltimbocca in Rome.  The best gelato on Earth is in San Gimignano, and in every part I had great pizza, pasta, and pastries.  You thought Japan, subsisting on a diet of raw fish, is the king of raw meat?  Well, don't miss the tartare on almost every menu in Italy.  Beef tartare prepared in many different ways, seafood tartare, and carapaccio.  I literally went for a late night snack of tartare on this trip because I was awake craving it.\n\n2. Japan\nFast food curry is actually damn good.  The highest quality fish was not at the conveyor belt sushi place we went to but it was cheap and much higher quality than the United States, plus a lot of fun.  The tempura is unbelievable.  Okinawan food is unique and delicious.  \n\n3. Argentina\nThe best quality meat and sausage on Earth, at least from the limited section of the globe I've been to.  The Pampas grass makes every bite of meat taste extra buttery.  I crave the parilla (assorted meats) I had at Don Julio in Buenos Aires all the time.",
      "Mexican food in general is hard to beat",
      "Complete opposite of you, went to Thessaloniki in Greece for work, our project had achieved an important milestone, so a decision was made to hire a private room in a restaurant that was normally closed for that day (I think it was Monday). \n\nThe food was sublime, out of the world brilliant. I can still taste some of those dishes over 15 years later.",
      "So many,  asados in Argentina, home cooked meal in Lebanon, full on turkish breakfast with assortements of cheeses and spreads. But nothing beats Vietnamese street food for me.",
      "We did a walking food tour in Athens Greece that was incredible. Whenever I think of traveling I think of that food tour \ud83e\udd23 it was just so good, the host was phenomenal and the other people in the group were so fun. The food was next level and plentiful.",
      "I was visiting my daughter and son in law in Malta. They took me on a weekend trip to Sicily. There I had the best food of my life. Everything I ate from Donkey salami to the pizza was amazing.",
      "Our cruise had a stop in St Maarten. When we got off the ship and into town I asked some of the locals where the best food was. All of them said to go to a beach side restaurant named, \"Caribbean Blend\".\n\nWhen we found the restaurant it was right on the beach. Not much to look at. A bar with some seating and a little shack next to it with an old bbq grill set up. And a even older guy doing the grilling.\n\nMy nephew and I ordered a couple of beers and we looked at the menu(our wives went shopping since they don't eat seafood).\n\nHe went for the grilled Grouper and I got the grilled Mahi-Mahi.\n\nTo this very day, that was the best seafood dish I've ever eaten.",
      "I've had a lot of good food, including in upscale restaurants, and have a weird list of memorable food, mostly from very random places.\n\nThe one I quite literally still dream about is the best goddamn fish taco in the world. I ate it in some tiny hole in the wall somewhere on the Mexican Quintana Roo. The thing was 3$ or so and in 5 days there, I went back 4 times. The place burned down a few months after that and I went back a few times to the area, hoping they rebuilt it somewhere. They never did, or at least I wouldn't know.\n\nIt's been 14 years and I still have to find a fish taco that is as good as that one was. I have been to 70 countries, including most of LatAm and a lot of Mexico again many times and have eaten my way through so many fish tacos but man, none compare.\n\nTwo honorary mentions: (1) baked mashed potatoes in a tiny restaurant I wouldn't ever find again in Fernando de Noronha/Brazil and (2) salmon with yuzu, ponzu and chili at BondSt in NYC - seriously that shit was so beyond excellent, I almost cancelled the rest of my order and told them to just bring me 5 more plates of it. Upside of this one is I know where I had it and can have it again if I want.",
      "For me Thai green chicken curry in Kyoto. We\u2019d just been traveling for quite some time and my family and I were exhausted so as we went out to search for food we walked maybe 100m out of the hotel and found this tiny hole in the wall Thai restaurant. Like it only seated 5-6 people and had maybe 6-7 dishes. And it was amazing, I still think about it to this day. In fact during our stay in Kyoto we ended up going back 3 times, which ended up being every evening we where there haha.",
      "In Copenhagen I had the most amazing 6 course meal while listening to MF Doom and Danish rappers who sound just like him. Place name is called \"Omar\".  Amazing vibe and good and drinks.  But that food was seriously incredible.",
      "Probably not the best food experience but the best hot dog I\u2019ve had was at the Copenhagen airport. I still think about that hot dog. The best falafel I had was from a little baggie of falafel that my tour guide in Jordan gave us. I don\u2019t know where it came from but it was fire. And I\u2019ve had my fair share of falafel.",
      "Food tour in South Korea, sushi in Osaka airport, cherry tomato pasta in portifono- these are what comes to mind. Also coming from the states I get very excited about Nandos lol (since we don\u2019t have that here). I\u2019ve been to 50 countries.\n\nEdited to add Khao Soi in Thailand! The best dish! I have tried to make it at home since not all Thai places have it.",
      "I've eaten a lot of amazing food in a lot of amazing places. The three that live in my head are: iced duck noodles in Kyoto, poke in Hawaii, and garlic mussels in the Isle of Lewis, Scotland.",
      "I was in Arequipa, Peru and everyone at my hostel kept raving about a vegan sushi place (i.e. no fish, just sushi from fruits, vegetables, and grains). My hostel mate and I were very skeptical as we couldn't imagine it was THAT good. \n\nWe ended up going as a group and doing a full scale multi-entree dinner/tasting menu. To this day it is the best restaurant experience and food I have ever had.",
      "Camden Loch market in London has booths from all over the world in their little food court and it\u2019s like international sensory overload. I love that place.",
      "A fresh caught salmon cooked on a hostel grill that a handsome blonde hippy guy shared with me in Quebec.\n\nFresh baked shoti puri bread straight out of the tone oven in Georgia. Also any freshly made khachapuri while in Georgia.\n\nSeeing how long the line for a table was at Past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m and deciding to get a half dozen to go. Then enjoying them, still warm, while walking in the garden across the street and then along the waterfront. \n\nTurkish breakfast with all the delicious fixings on a scorching hot morning in a little gazebo right next to a freezing cold river where we could put our feet. \n\nnot a food but a drink.....homemade pomegranate and sage syrups made with fruit and herbs from the garden and diluted with ice cold sparkling water at an artist's home in Bosnia."

      "Honestly, I love airplane food. I'm in awe of the fact that I'm flying along at 500 mph at 39,000 feet, and someone is offering me a hot meal. (Think about what people had to eat on ships that made the transatlantic crossing centuries ago.) I appreciate the clever packaging, and generally enjoy the meal, even though it is usually mediocre. Occasionally, I'm surprised by a really tasty entree, but I'm not a picky eater in general.",
      "I technically eat airplane food but when flying from the US to Europe, it\u2019s typically done at night and they serve dinner right when I should be trying to fall asleep. Eating wakes the body up a bit. I sleep better when I skip the airplane dinner and try to eat something before boarding, even if it\u2019s a little early.",
      "I don't eat airplane food, as I find it unappetizing. I fly a lot, but always Economy. I bring food (sandwiches and snacks) and fill up a water bottle with water after security.",
      "No. I always eat it. In some ways I am lucky in that I am not really picky about food. It has to be absolutely horrific for me not to eat it. This has served me well in life.",
      "My daughter has serious food allergies, so we always bring food for her, and sometimes us as well. Because of the doctor's note, we get an extra personal item for her insulated tote/lunch bag. But if you put everything else in your carry on, I bet you could do the same with a lunch bag as personal item",
      "Thought I was the only one. I'd eat a big meal at the airport to get me through. Honestly think it's vile, makes hospital food feel like you're at a steak house in Buenos Aires.\n\nMind-blowing how the budget airlines have better food than the long haulers, I'd happily pay on the flight for better quality food even if it's just a fucking Panini like you get on RyanAir.",
      "I actually enjoy plane food! It\u2019s interesting to see what different airlines offer! Flying from Australia to China I had a brilliant mango cheesecake! Flying from India to Malaysia and we had a brilliant curry!",
      "okay this might sound douchey but I fly business almost exclusively -- and the food is something I look forward too \u2014 I feel like there's a lot of attention towards umami rich foods in the sky, and the cocktails always hit different.",
      "I do everything I can before a long flight...Eat a large meal, hydrate, poop, etc.   I'll bring some of my own snacks and water.  I tend to stay way from from drinking anything with ice on the plane, water unless I see it come out of a bottle because I dont trust the cleanliness. I'll pick at the food but  sometimes it just isn't good, so I have my snacks.  If I get to fly business I find the food is better so ill bring fewer snacks.",
      "I never had a bad experience with plane food. I eat their food while flying internationally for sure.",
      "Tip from a guy who used to have to fly monthly on cheap airlines where the food was sometimes weird and fishy. There is a whole menu with stuff like allergenic meals but more interestingly, ethnic / religious meals and every (most?) airport needs to be equip to handle these requests. I tried them all and came up with the Hindu meal being the best most of the time. It\u2019s usually some simple chicken and rice, lentils or something like that. Side of curried pickles, maybe some Nan bread. Occasionally, like from Hong Kong airport, it was outstanding.\u00a0\n\nEither way, it\u2019s usually a much more easily digestible and palatable meal. And bonus, I would usually get served first cause it was a special order.\u00a0",
      "Depends on which airline I\u2019m flying with honestly. I\u2019ve found Cathay Pacific, Air NZ and Singapore Airlines to be good quality food that\u2019s actually edible.  Typically I eat before I board if I have the time and take snacks when I know the meal(s) are a no go.",
      "To quote Anthony Bourdain, \n\n\"Never. No one has ever felt better after eating plane food. I think people only eat it because they're bored. I don't eat on planes. I like to arrive hungry.\"",
      "Yes. I fly from NA to SA and I\u2019m vegan so basically everything United has, including snacks, isn\u2019t vegan. They added like 2 or 3 vegan snack options last year tho so I actually do eat plane food now. And then there\u2019s airport food too that\u2019s good",
      "Norse Atlantic had the worst food I've had on an airplane. It was so salty I couldn't eat it. Usually I select low sodium meals for health reasons but they didn't have that option. I don't expect to fly them again, but if I do I'll pack a sandwich or something for the relatively short flight to Europe. Delta and American and their codeshare airlines have been at least decent enough for economy meals, but the international partners have better meals than the US ones. But after flying multiple flights I kept getting the same meal and got tired of it.",
      "When I travel internationally i pretty much never eat the plane food. It isn\u2019t good so I don\u2019t have a taste for it. I just eat when I land\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

      "I don\u2019t eat plane food, even if I\u2019m flying a 16 hours flight, in business class or economy class, just no.\n\nI was a flight attendant for over a decade and the smell of foods in-flight actually makes me sick, and the smell of eggs even disgusts me. And it helps me to fast during the flight so I can adjust better.",
      "I don\u2019t eat plane food bc for some reason, I\u2019ve always thought it\u2019s the sodium, it makes me feel ill. Every time I tried it I would end up with a stomachache. My solution is to pack my own food. It varies depending on the length of the flight but I\u2019ve made protein heavy snack boxes, baguette sandwiches and occasionally even a large salad. You\u2019d be surprised how many food options there are if you have the time to get creative. I like to pack my food in a Tupperware type container and then wash to reuse for snacks wherever I\u2019m visiting.",

      "Yes, but mainly because I have a food allergy. I\u2019ve been on a transatlantic flight where both food options had the \u2018May contain\u2019 option on them. I also bring my own snacks and if needed, get a meal at the airport I can bring on the plane",
      "I didn't eat 'dinner' on a red eye to Frankfort. It was 2 am in the morning, all I wanted to do was attempt to sleep in lowly economy class. All I could smell was cafeteria food.  Yet people were chowing down at 2 am \ud83e\udd37",
      "Weird thing to be \"principled\" about. Like yeah sometimes I'll get better food before If i have time. But like when you are 2,000 miles away from a coast are you really gonna be that firm about it.",
      "I mostly refuse to eat plane food, and I travel international at least once per year. \n\nI have found that a large amount of my travel constipation was due to consuming dense, processed, carb heavy plane food while seated mostly motionless for many hours on a plane. \n\nI tend to eat a salad at a restaurant in the airport, and eat a few snacks over my flight, but I don't eat the meal they serve aside from maybe picking at any healthy sides they serve.",
      "On one business trip to India, three out of four people on my team got sick shortly after landing, despite staying in separate hotels.  Airplane food and drinks was the only thing they had in common...  \n\nI eat airplane food, but I also bring snack bars, etc. in case I don't like it, don't have enough, etc.",

It\u2019s incredibly inconvenient, especially on long flights. I try to have a really big meal at home before going to the airport, and bring snacks with me. If I have a layover I usually use it to try and eat another big meal if they have food options that are safe at the airport, otherwise I buy (incredibly expensive) snacks for the last leg of the journey. Then when I land I treat myself to some real food.",

I carry fast-acting sugar and something for emergencies, but juice or a snack are more fun than sugar tablets. \n\nI also fly carriers that have decent food. The Korean airlines, Singapore Air, and Thai Air do meal service well. I think Air France does a decent job of it. They're my preferred carrier to Europe. I've not flown to places like the Middle East, Africa, spots further into Europe, or India, so I don't have a full view of what other airlines serve. Even American carriers do a decent job. \n\nPeople are entitled to their reasons. For me, it's a somewhat fancier version of cafeteria food. In most cases, it's not bad, and sometimes it's a pleasant surprise.",
      "I personally do eat the food and choose the option \\*I\\* think sounds the most appetizing BUT I am a fan of the great Anthony Bourdain who didn't eat any plane food either. He said he likes to arrive hungry and the food at his destinations would always be better than plane food.",

      "I never eat airplane food! I eat a meal before and bring healthy snacks on the flight. Longest I've gone is 15 hours but I had dried fruit, nuts, oatmeal, peanut butter with crackers, apples, bananas, etc. Never went hungry :) airplane food just kills me.",
      "If it helps, I once had a role where I visited back of house facilities at airports around the world. Went to a lot of catering suppliers, and even in developing countries the food hygiene standards were sound. I eat plane food (but then again I eat any food if it\u2019s put in front of me).",
      "I don\u2019t mostly bc I have a really sensitive stomach and it can flip on me randomly - basically like IBS plus a lot of intolerances\u2026 I don\u2019t really fancy spending the flight going back and forth to the bathroom. I\u2019ve tried the vegetarian meals etc, they all upset my stomach to a degree so I just don\u2019t bother anymore. I usually just take a small package of biscuits and a couple of my safe food snacks and eat them throughout the flight so I don\u2019t have an entirely empty stomach. \n\n*I recently flew Japan Airlines and all their food looked really good tbh - I did eat the yuzu sorbet they gave me for dessert and it was 10/10",
      "I can't eat airplane food in economy, all those preservatives kill my stomach and make me throw up. If I am flying economy, I buy food to bring on and put it in a Ziploc or eat before boarding. Food in business and first class are better quality.",
      "There are times I\u2019ve refused the meal traveling international business because it\u2019s still just bottom tier cafeteria food and i just wanna sleep. Other times I eat because I\u2019m hungry. I\u2019m flying JAL business soon and excited to try the food. All depends",
      "If you have access to a lounge for free, e.g. through a premium credit card or frequent flyer program, they usually have food that's much better than what you get on the plane.

      "My kids refused when you get flying home on a 12 hour flight. I kept telling them they had to eat something (as both my kids get sick when they have bad headaches). Yes I had protein bars with me that they ate before we took off. \n\nThey refused the airline food (age 9 and 13) one threw up 45 min before we landed and the other threw up as we we were walking off the jet bridge. Going alone through customs in JFK with both of them was a blast. \n\nFood is fuel. I get it if people have GI sensitivities and need to bring their own for long flights for that.",

      "There's something about the smell of plane food that makes me physically sick. I have held my nose for 13 hour flights before (not with my hands just not breathing with my nose. I was about 12 at the time).\nI'm a med student so I've seen and smelt some pretty disgusting things, but for some reason plane food always gets me",
      "I don\u2019t touch airplane food. A handful of years back flying from Heathrow to ATL (or JFK or somewhere else, hell I can\u2019t recall). About an hour into the flight food is served and I eat this whole chicken loaf thing. 15 - 30 min later, I am not feeling so good and head to the restroom. I spent the next 6 hours of that flight in / out of the restroom vomiting without reprieve. That was the worst, most miserable 6 hours of my life.",
      "I usually skip all the plane food. I pack snacks for myself. If it's a long flight, I will grab some fast food at the airport before boarding. \n\nI'm a picky eater, so I usually don't like much of what they serve. And then you get stuck with it sitting on your tray table for however long it takes them to come and collect things. So I've found it better to just skip the whole thing.\n\nI remember an exception though - one time I was on a plane that handed out Chocolate Chip Ice Cream cups for a snack - it was delicious!",
      "I eat the food. It's usually tasty Asian foods or a pasta dish which I like. I also get the food before anyone else. My secret: requesting the vegetarian menu. I do it because I am vegetarian, but IMO it's a more enjoyable experience because those dishes are very good and harder to get wrong. You can do it online up to 24 hours before the flight.",
      "I am annoyed by people who are melodramatic about how \u201cbad\u201d airplane food is. It\u2019s usually whatever, it\u2019s not great food but I\u2019ve never found it inedible. I can see maybe eating before or bringing your food if it\u2019s a shorter international like say 6 hours, but longer than that I need to eat. I have flown the 13hr trip to Japan many times\u2026 you get two meals and you need to eat at least one of them because you\u2019re spending half an entire day on a plane and you get freaking hungry. And no I\u2019m not going to get some shitty sandwich in the terminal and unpack it six hours later when I get hungry \n\nI",
      "Flying from Oslo to Reykjavik on Icelandair I was starving. On the list of food there was a $12 sub. It came heated\u2026..I think it was the best sub I\u2019ve eaten! Probably because I was starving!",
      "I wonder oh much of this is distance. New york to Iceland is 5 or 6 hours, pretty easy to skip the meal if you don\u2019t like the food. New York to Singapore is almost 19hrs. That makes it harder to just skip the meals without packing a day\u2019s worth of food or being really hungry. If I am miserable on a 19 hr flight, I don\u2019t want to add additional misery of being hungry.",
      "It depends. on Air Canada, I carry my food because you can not eat that AC garbage.",

Last year I had a 4 hour flight I thought would had a meal, but they only gave out biscoff cookies. I really missed and appreciated plane food then. When I got to the airport, I ate overpriced airport food.",
      "Depends on airline. I usually eat it and even ask if more is available after the service ends \ud83d\ude06 \n\nThere\u2019s airlines with good food (Turkish), airlines with mediocre food (80%) and airlines with bad food (LOT, Aeroflot). \n\nI fly LOT a lot because I live in Poland, but god damn their food is awful so I always end up getting McDonalds takeaway \ud83d\ude06 luckily there\u2019s one conveniently placed in WAW. On our last long haul with them a couple of months ago from JFK to WAW the food was inedible.

      "I have tried a fair few times as I fly internationally often. I physically cannot eat. I will go 14 hours without eating at all. I feel fine, and as soon as food starts getting served I feel nauseous and cannot eat. I hate it. I get off the plane and I'm literally shaking. I have tried to bring my own food but I get the same thing. I took chips on a domestic flight with me the other day and I could only eat a handful before I felt sick. If I'm lucky, sometimes I can eat a piece of bread with butter on it. Save me.",
      "My brother got severe food poisoning from airplane food going to London for a vacation. Poor guy tried to tough it out of a double decker bus but ended up throwing up in a subway sandwich bag while everyone moved upstairs to the top deck to avoid the chaos. We ended up leaving on the next stop so he could rest at the hotel. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy because we ordered the same food on the airplane and sat right next to each other. So it could\u2019ve been either one of us.",
      "Only once could i truly not eat the food. A QANTAS flight to LA in 2017. It truly was disgusting. Looked literally like shit. It stank.\nApparently some Luke Mangan inspired Morrocan dish\ud83e\udd2e\n\nBut otherwise? Ill eat everything. Some airline food ive had has been delicious.",
      "No way lol I love plane food. It's something you can only get on the plane and it's just part of the experience. Like, flying is just such a treat for me the food is part of it.",

      "I eat minimal plane food. Unfortunately it's due to allergies. Airlines suck at allowing you to select meals that accommodate allergens outside of: peanut, vegan, vegetarian, kosher. My main 3 allergens are usually main ingredients. So I have to stick to eating before boarding, bringing protein bars or other snacks, and making do with the side salad or something like that. \n\n\nJust did a few 12+ hour flights over the past month and it was rough.",

      "I don't refuse it, but I get it.   People say not eating food at altitude will reduce jet lag.  These people say your digestive system doesn't really function at high altitude, so when you come down and have to digest all that fatty, salty food it can really make you feel tired.\n\nI eat it anyway, but TBH I don't seem to have a functioning digestive system for 48 hours after I fly.  I always attributed this to jet lag but who knows\u2026",

That kind of guarantees bloating, water retention, weight gain, restlessness and thirst.\n\nI used to bring healthy teas, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, healthy light snacks and order bottled water and juice on the plane. I experimented with ordering the low sodium meal or other alternatives. They were not much better usually.\u00a0\n\nBut I haven\u2019t flown in a while, maybe things improved!\u00a0\n\nAlso there are some airlines that have food worth breaking your diet for, such as Air France.\u00a0",

Only ended up eating bread because I got sick by the smell and taste of the meal.",
      "I\u2019ve just had a lot of run ins with airplane food on international flights. I stick to the cold packaged aspects of the meal, and I refuse the heated up prepackaged part if that makes sense. If it\u2019s just fruit or whatever, that\u2019s fine. It usually tastes good, but the hot meal part always gives me diarrhea, gas, and makes me nauseous. A breakfast burrito on the way to Athens nearly took me out once. I\u2019ve had a few flight attendants become overly concerned that I wasn\u2019t eating, and even mock me \u201care we going to be brave and try some fruit?\u201d \ud83d\ude02 yeah Linda the fruit is fine, Id just prefer not to propel myself down the aisle with my bowel contents and ground the flight. I\u2019m going to be okay. So I eat saltines, cheese and biscoff cookies for 14 hours. I\u2019m not going to die.

      "Me, I refuse to for a few reasons.\n\nOne: I'm trying to get on a new timezone clock, eating when I'm hungry will just keep me on mine, be hungry and eat a big meal when you land. \n\nTwo: I swear the meals make me feel bloated, like they're high fiber military rations that are designed to keep you full but not going to the bathroom. \n\nThree: food takes a while to digest, I'm trying to sleep not turn more biological systems on.\n\nSo I get a can of tomato juice on the plane, add salt and pepper and after I drink it I sleep. No food until I land. I bring a big bottle of water, and a small candy snack that I grab a few if I'm feeling really hungry.",
      "I always bring my own food on any long plane rides. Usually plane food is total garbage. Based on what is at the airport I fly from I try to bring some noodles, a sub, something on rice, etc. Plus I always have my own snacks. There's no use suffering through crappy plane food when I can usually get something decent before I board.",
      "Standards for airplane food is one of the graetest in the whole world. Just watch the logistics necessary for the kitchen to make food for so many airplane companies... they are all covered. From head to toes. Like people working at the chip factories...\n\nIf anything we should trust airplane food. It is not some street vendor on the side of the road",
      "I never eat airplane food. I\u2019ll either use that as a time to fast (and helps me acclimate to local time eating schedule once I land and eat). Or if I do I\u2019ll usually eat before hand or bring something small. I\u2019m also a fitness junkie so YMMV.",
      "Flew Virgin from BOS to LHR and I REALLY enjoyed the food. My moms vegetarian and they brought her meal out first and she really liked it too (pasta/chicken pot pie, veggies, salad, chocolate ice cream). I will add that we flew Condor from PVD to FRA and that was really bad. They gave us a slice of \"bread\" that was so dense with seeds/whole grains I was picking my teeth for the rest of the flight.",
      "Me ! I never eat plane food. I have a very sensitive sense of smell, am a vegetarian, and can't stand the smell of reheated food in small spaces. I also am a bit alarmed by the plastic waste for packaging, and while I'm aware I'm not making any difference, I feel a little better by not unnecessarily using so much plastic myself. \n\nIf my flight is overnight, I eat something before I get on, sleep and eat something once I get off, and carry a fruit or granola bar with me. \n\nIf my flight is during the day, I usually bring along a packed meal and a couple of snacks in my handbag and just eat that :).",
      "I don't like the plane food lol. I usually try and and bring food with me to eat.",
      "I guess you never had a Continental meatloaf sandwich. \u2026 Now I always bring some food with me just in case",
      "I usually eat airplane food but always have snacks with me in case I don't like it."

I\u2019ve never had a bad meal in either. \n\nKyoto- I\u2019d love to spend my last week on Earth in this city just gouging myself on every possible dish. \n\nBologna Italy, I go back every year for a few days just for the food and a suitcase full of goodies to bring back. \n\nSan Sebasti\u00e1n- it\u2019s very good. It\u2019s not cheap though and when your there you have to eat at a Michelin star. It\u2019s why you go. \n\nLondon- I have a soft spot for London. You can find very good food from almost anywhere in the world. Best Indian food outside of india (I can\u2019t eat anything in india as it always makes me violently Ill).",
      "Haven't been to every city in the world to do a fair compariso, but some of my favorites:  Copenhagen, Florence, mexico City. \n\nNever been but want to try - San Sebastian, specifically because I've had great food in every Spanish city I've been to, but that one is supposedly the best.\n\nUnderrated: Philadelphia (sandwich capital of the world)\n\nNot a city but... hole in the wall barbecue places throughout the southeast usa.",

But somewhere else like, say, Toronto, which has a massive amount of immigrants has super high quality food from a huge range of countries, including Japanese and many others. Do you care about local food only or diversity of good food available?",
      "New York or London for the wide variety of food from around the world that you can find in any other city.",

      "Mexico City for me\n\nAlthough my city Houston should be in the mix. We\u2019re an extremely diverse city and have access to almost all types of food. We seem to be underrated, no one realizes we\u2019re one of the most diverse cities in the world",

All was relatively simple but delicious food and not expensive.",

You have the entire range of cheap to fine dining, variety of cuisines, and a large immigrant population.\n\nParis has great food, but only at higher prices. Chicago is amazing, but the selection isn't as wide as other cities. Even Detroit has a surprising variety of cheap food, but they don't have the higher end restaurants you'd get in a larger city. \n\nThe more I've read about Michelin stars, the less I feel the need to go to their restaurants. They are really good at judging traditional European fine dining, but aren't great at judging foods invented in North and South America.",

Each of these cities have top tier produce, but are also special for different reasons such as their traditional recipes or their fusion and blend of cultures.

Vesuvius. Some of the best wines and olive oil there are.\n\n3rd:\nBangkok: Amazing seafood and Thai cuisine. Rhe fruit markets are breathtaking.\n\nHonerable mentions:\nSingapore, Paris, Istanbul.\n\nWhat I really can't understand is why people (primarily Americans I assume) are so hyped about Mexican food. I travelled around Mexico quite a bit and besides a few pearls stayed quite disappointed about the food. As soon as you leave the coast the food practically becomes refried sick topped with substandard tasteless cheese.\nThe same in Turkey, minus the refried sick but with lots of sheep intestines.

By no means are we gourmet or fancy but if you want the best sports watching, beer pairing, good time having food, Buffalo is the place to go.",
      "Not gonna lie, Atlanta is pretty awesome where food is concerned.",
      "Melbourne, Australia.  Amazing variety of Asian food beyond the typical Korean, chinese, sushi/ramen you find in the states",
      "I think it totally depends on what you personally like. I can't eat spicy foods which totally does away with most Asian and Latin foods. I prefer Northern and Eastern European dishes like stews, strogonoff , and things like that. So I would say places like Paris, or Vienna.",

      "Greece, Montreal, Colombia, Cambodia are the best places for me in terms of food so far",
      "Lima, Peru. There is a reason why Peru has been nominated as the best culinary destination many times. It's a country with amazing seafood and a variation of altitudes and produce that is almost unparalleled. You add in the influence of the cultures who have immigrated there and end up with an extraordinary cuisine and Lima is at the heart of their food scene.",
      "For me this has to be broken up in a couple of ways. Best food city for that ethnic or regional cuisine, which for me is San Sebasti\u00e1n, CDMX, or Hanoi. Or best place to eat full stop, which includes diversity and then NYC or LA are great choices.",
      "I\u2019ve been fortunate to spend time in most if US, Europe, Middle East and India. Indian food done right is hard to beat. Some of the best I\u2019ve found is in Scotland. But for a single city, New Orleans is just amazing. Cajun, creole, french and now Mexican being folded in; wow.",
      "Realizing it\u2019s totally subjective my vote would be London. I\u2019m biased because I lived there for 5 years but the amount of variety is amazing.\n\nWalk down one street and you will find amazing Indian food, French food, Thai, Vietnamese, late night drunk donner kebabs, the list goes on and on. \n\nI also think British food gets a bad rap. Love a proper English breakfast, fish & chips, and scotch eggs! \n\nDang, I\u2019m hungry now \ud83d\ude03",
      "IMO Krakow Poland doesn't get enough credit. You can eat Michelin-starred food like a king for pennies. Another underrated spot is Montreal. New age french with an American appetite. Delicious.",
      "Lima Peru I loved. Guadalajara was good. Wish I can try more on these lists, but if you haven\u2019t tried Lima cuisine you are missing out on amazing seafood and mixed culture meals",
      "I would say San Francisco. There's food from every part of the world and the produce grown in Northern California is just superior!!",
      "Gonna have to disagree with a lot of the Japanese nominations here. I\u2019m not saying that they have bad food, far from it. However they are specialized in the Japanese department (of course), and won\u2019t make for a good city to visit to try a lot of different things. Someone who is looking for variety as well as quality will have to go to North America, no other location has as much immigration bringing worldwide cuisine in.\n\nIn terms of my nominations: id have to say NYC an LA. Sleeper hits would be MSP and DFW.",
      "This might be a basic bitch answer but Paris had a mind-boggling amount of world-class restaurants in almost every niche cuisine you could dream up, and every budget; it wasn't just a bunch of stuffy bistros serving vol au vents and ratatouille for 200 euros a head.\n\nHonorable mention goes to Hong Kong for a fuckload of amazing street food and the best Szechuan food I've ever had.",
      "Aw, man. Best food while traveling.\n\nVery long time ago by an old lady crouching and selling chicken cooked over a charcoal brazier at a bus stop in southern Thailand. When I asked for more, she pointed at her wrist, put up 5 fingers and tapped it 3 times. 15 minutes or so later, I had my second helping of the best grilled chicken I've ever had.\n\nSitting on a beach on Ko Samet, I had the best ever shrimp while watching fishermen in small boats shrimping with lanterns in the dark on the horizon knowing they'd be on my table the next day. \n\nFresh pineapple on the Malaysian street chopped from the full fruit in the vendor's palm with a machete and served on a skewer.\n\nThe key to all of these is the freshness.",

One of the coolest things about travel is when you can talk with/see someone else doing similar things to what you have done. It is like you are in a secret club together.\n\nOne correction: It is a myth that returning soldiers invented the name \"French fries\". The word *frenching* (note: lower case) referred to trimming small pieces off of a larger object (similar to chipping). Thomas Jefferson's 1802 cookbook has a recipe for \"fried potatoes, cut French style.\" By 1856 this was appearing in cookbooks as \"French fried potatoes\" and *Good Housekeeping* was using the term \"French Fries\" by 1899.

Fresh cacao pods, apple bananas, dragonfruit, lychee, longan, and passion fruit were some of the highlights of Hawaii for me. Blood Oranges were one of the many highlights of Italy.

I've learned to be particularly careful here and it still doesn't seem to make a difference. I've eaten fairly freely in India, Cambodia, Indonesia, Peru....the list goes on. It's only here that I am so badly affected. \n\nDoes anyone else have similar troubles but only in one particular country? Could it be something about the bugs in Mexico in particular that are hard for me to handle?",

      "India makes me violently ill from the moment I land. I don\u2019t even touch the street food, only eat home cooked food. Nothing uncooked and avoid fruit and meat like the plague. Yet I can bet \u00a31m I\u2019ll never have a solid bowl movement in that country.  \n\nYet Lived in Cambodia for 9 months, ate out every day and only had the runs once. Caused by KFC out of all places (my picky visiting friend wouldn\u2019t eat the local food). \n\nThailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Turkey, Indonesia, Laos. I\u2019ve eaten street food without any consequences.\n\nI\u2019ve put it down to the background bacteria. Our guts have a complex biome of bacteria, I\u2019d imagine every country or region to have a different make up of bacteria local to the environment and climate. All I know for sure is my stomach doesn\u2019t like whatever there is in india.",
      "Are you sure it\u2019s bacteria rather than an ingredient that is common in the food you select? If you can make it though India and Cambodia without some bacterial nastiness you have a very strong gut biome.",
      "I'm a firm believer in Montezuma's revenge. It's an actual magical curse that's causing your food poisoning.",
      "Your stomach is used to different types of bacteria.  Has very little to do with food quality or cleanliness (unless you are intentionally eating at dumpsites)\n\nI grew up in South America, I remember that before I lived in the US, I would ALWAYS get sick the first few weeks here.",
      "You sure it's food poisoning? It can also be sensitivity for some ingredient. Had this happen with some spices in Ethiopia. While there regular diarrhea, back home fine till I started using some of the spices I had brought from Ethiopia. Small amounts spaced well apart was no issue, but every time when using liberal amounts of the specific spice mix I got diarrhea.  There is always a chance of food poisoning, but if there is a clear pattern, with a certain cuisine it may very well be some kind of sensitivity.",
      "I've been to over 50 countries on every continent and the only time I've gotten food poisoning was in Mexico too.",
      "I had a project in Mexico in the 1980's and every time I went there (at least 15 times over three years) I got sick as you described. Every time. And I am very aware of water and food precautions and follow them fastidiously. One time I got full blown Montezuma's revenge but that was different. It was probably the different bacteria like people here say -- no pathogens, just different. But I'll never go to Mexico again.",
      " I travelled to Bolivia once. Whatever I had (from potatoes to rice to chicken to chips to baby food) I was sick about 4-6 times a day every single day of the trip! \nEnded up going to the hospital in Chile to check what was wrong and as soon as I told them I was in Bolivia before they were like \u201coh that\u2019s Bolivia for most people, most foreigners coming the the clinic come because of Bolivia. Just drink water and you should be good in 24h\u201d. And indeed, I stopped getting sick very quickly.",
      "I was hospitalized after returning from Mexico. I had to extend my stay a day and get a Dr to come give me a shot. I couldn\u2019t stop puking and could not fly.   I\u2019ve been sick with food poisoning twice, once there and once at the shore after eating crustacean.   I was never so sick in my life as I was in Mexico. Not sure what got me but I nearly died.",
      "I got a mild stomach ache the first time I had a banh mi in Vietnam.  It was a few days in and I'm not sure if it was the mayo or the pate but it wasn't that bad.  After that I never got sick, at least from food.  I got the runs after eating fish tacos with lots of salsa in Mexico, but it wasn't all that bad.",
      "The first time in MX for me was really bad, definitely food poisoning. Each of the five times afterward have been fine. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re so unlucky in this particular place; as you know, Mexico is otherwise amazing",
      "Different foods and water frim various locations have different bacteria. Its likely that your gut isnt used to those forms of bacteria. You should talk to your doctor about probiotics.",
      "Might be the water, not the food.",
      "I always bring probiotics with me on trips, along with activated charcoal. When I eat street food I follow the golden rule: only super busy vendors with lots of people get my money, as locals know what\u2019s good. \n\nI have traveled all over the world and never had a single issue until I ate runny eggs in India after weeks of eating yogurt and muesli. I now avoid eggs when I travel due to the hell I experienced. \nUnless they cooked very hard. \n\nBut I pregame my trips to places with strong probiotics and take them daily when I travel.",
      "You are very likely not getting food poisoning but you are getting the water in something you are eating. The water isn't poisonous but you aren't used to the minerals. And it vastly effects some worse than others.",
      "Yes I was so violently ill after my trip to mexico. Sickest I\u2019ve ever been. I think it was the ice or some food that had been washed in the water (i.e. salad). Either way, it was bad enough that I haven\u2019t been back yet because I\u2019m scared to experience that again lol",
      "This is me but also India. Spent 6 months all over Mexico last year and had some form of gastric distress the entire time despite drinking only bottled water. A friend thinks it might be something to do with the stray dogs. He thinks the stray dog poop dries up and gets blown through the air, settling on everything. I\u2019ve also seen many food prep surfaces being wiped down with dirty rags and tap water. I\u2019ve also spent months in Thailand and never been sick at all!",
      "Try not eating food with you hands, use cutlery. Every single person I suggest this to has responded to me that they don\u2019t\u2019 get sick. In some cases, only one partner doesn\u2019t eat with their hands , while the other does. The person eating with their hands is the only one getting sick.",
      "Mexico \n\n1) Bagged ice only in drinks\n\n2) Only bottled water\n\n3) If the restaurant isn't busy don't eat there.  They are not turning over their food.\n\n4) Wash your hands a lot.",
      "It\u2019s possible you contracted Hep A. I was in Mexico in January drinking blended and iced drinks at the bar, ended up getting violently ill and also thought it was food poisoning. Came back, went to my pcp did blood work and lo and behold, hep a. Its very common apparently.",
      "Dealing with horrible food poisoning post Mexico. It\u2019s a miracle I made it on my flight back to the states yesterday. I didn\u2019t drink the water, but I did have ice/fruit and a quesadilla from a street cart vendor. Not sure what the culprit was but man this is rough",
      "You need to do some investigation:\n\nDo you get the same food poising when you drink or eat Mexican products in the US. How about Corona, Dos Equis or Modelo? For Mexican food you can try Mexgrocer.\n\nMexGrocer.com is a nationwide bilingual online grocery store for hard-to-find, non-perishable authentic Mexican food, household products, cooking tips, Mexican recipes, Mexican cookbooks, and religious goods.

MexGrocer.com is a California Limited Liability company and was founded in early 2000 in San Diego, California.\n\nTry different Mexican foods to see if one of them triggers your illnesses. Then you can avoid that in Mexico. If you can eat and drink these products and not get sick in the US stick to them when you travel to Mexico and you should be okay.",
      "Everyone gets food poisoning in Mexico. Most American stomachs are not made for none 1st world countries.",
      "I'm not sure. I've only had severe poisoning in the US and Peru and mild food poisoning in Turkey. Oddly enough, I didn't have problems in Mexico, but maybe it's because I still had the bug from Peru in my system, so I couldn't get any sicker than I already was. \n\nI'm genuinely shocked that you've never been sick in India or SE Asia, and I honestly have a hard time believing people who claim they've never been sick in India.\n\nPeru is like number 4 on the list of food poisoning countries, but I was fine in Peru, until I ate from a buffet next to a river in the countryside.\n\nAs for Mexico, I hear stories, but I've had a few meals and drinks in Mexico and didn't any problems. Maybe they're deliberately putting something in your food.",
      "Do you just wait it out? I just returned from Cabo over the weekend and my stomach is noooot happy. Should I just eat bland foods and wait for normalcy to return?",
      "The people preparing the food are dirty and have no knowledge of proper food handling. Make your own food. You pay money to suffer when you eat out and have strangers source and make your food.",
      "Parasites and bad bacteria are in the food and drink. If your immune system is very strong and can kill the parasites you are OK, however I think your chances of getting an intestinal infection from parasites is extremely high no matter where you eat, street food or restaurants. I know from a lot of experience and living in Mexico for 3 years. This is from my experience, your mileage may vary.",
      "reading this with food poisoning in cabo \ud83e\udee0",
      "Don\u2019t eat street food. I live in Mexico and for the most part it\u2019s fine but I do get cases of \u2018Mexican belly\u2019 every now and then \ud83d\ude02",
      "Could also be the lack of fiber. Mexican food is meat heavy and low on vegetables. Unless you\u2019re pounding fruit (which comes with its own risks) you\u2019re probably not getting enough fiber. I took some metamucil last trip and it definitely helped.",
      "I once heard a quote from a friend \"only eat the deep fried food if you didn't see it get made... \ud83d\ude05",
      "You are weak. Your stomach and biome are weak. You eat sterilized factory food. You literally cannot handle unprocessed foods. Don't say you do..they literally won't sell it to you. Fresher food with little/no regulation= Hershey squirts. But if you stay long enough and suffer through a month straight of painting walls brown..you can and will eat anything...forever, it's wild.",
      "I lived in India and Mexico. I never got sick in India despite being very reckless. I honestly thing it's the extreme fat and salt content in mexican food, plus the need to have a sugary coke with every meal",
      "Looks like you don't have enzymes, viruses, bacteria or whatever to digest food that gives you food poisoning. \n\nStop eating packaged food that Congress from any type of factory and eat fresh, cooked food that comes from plants and trees with herbs, spices",
      "A friend advised me to drink kombucha daily for two weeks leading up to a trip to Mexico - it either worked or the food was a non issue in general.",
      "There\u2019s no standard for food safety there. They don\u2019t wash their hands or use gloves and never temp meats to make sure they\u2019re cooked. Personally, I\u2019d never eat in a country like this if it\u2019s prepared on the street or even a restaurant in a bad looking area. There\u2019s no concern for people\u2019s health after they eat, they just want the tourism money.",
      "I got sick from the food and drinks on the plane on the way back.",
      "I all-time eating tacos Mexican food is Soo gopd",
      "I traveled extensively in China and never got sick.... Except for highly spiced / hot spicy food which probably would give me the stomach gurgling in the USA as well. Never food poisoning or sick from even hole in the wall restaurants... I avoided street meats or certain types of street food\n\nJust need to be careful where and how you eat... I bet ice is doing it... Straight liquors and no water and ice is good practice for drinks\n\nBottle waters only",
      "I've gotten food poisoning in Vietnam, India, Columbia and El Salvador, haha. I've also been to many countries where I did not get food poisoning, just for context.",
      "I use grapefruit seed extract in most foreign countries. Basically a few drops a day in water and it kills most food born germs. It can mess with medication so be careful of that. In Mexico I bring hydration tablets. Each morning I dissolve a hydration tab in water and add a few drops of grapefruit seed extract. It's a great combo. No dehydration from the heat and no stomach issues.",
      "The main issue I\u2019ve seen other travelers encounter is some places don\u2019t wash their dishes with filtered water, which can end up in drinks or food. You just have to be hyper vigilant. \n\nAvoid anything that hasn\u2019t been cooked, period. No fresh fruit or vegetables unless you\u2019ve washed them in bottled water yourself. Even with that extra step I always avoid fresh fruit and vegetables unless I\u2019ve foraged for them myself or with someone i deeply trust. \n\nObviously be careful about the ice, but I would go as far as to not use any drink containers that aren\u2019t bottled. Bring your own water purification system, whatever you know works for you.\n\nTry staying away from meat if possible, I think that\u2019s where most people get sick who are being hyper vigilant already. While traveling in Nepal a friend became incapacitated from some goat. \n\nI have a very sensitive stomach, but I\u2019ve never gotten sick in Mexico in all my years of going, and I lived in India/Nepal for six months and never had a problem. I even ate street food consistently, which is not something I would have foreseen myself doing. But I never had an issue, luckily!",
      "I was sick as a dog after a night out in Mallorca. For months. Tested numerous times for hepatitis. \n\nBeen to Mexico many many times and never had an issue. My husband got terrible food poisoning once when the rest of us refused to  eat the questionable food.  \n\nHowever, we have gotten sick elsewhere when the water treatment system was not working right and no one knew. Until everyone was sick. \n\nWe have found in our travels that certain people react differently to different substances. I know people that won't drink certain beer or eat certain places because of the results when others have no issue.",
      "Did you swim in ocean, river or lake?  Most of my family got sick from ocean swimming in rainy season in Puerto Vallarta. The bay can have high levels of bacteria, especially near the rivers.  Street food there is generally very safe.",
      "Anecdotal but I eat it plant based and avoid meat, dairy and alcohol and have never ever gotten sick in Mexico (even w buffet rice, beans, veg, salad and fruit, I drink and brush teeth w bottled water only), Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Bali, Costa Rica, Panama, Philippines, All over Polynesia and western countries.  Perhaps more fecal bacteria on hands when people prepare or process meat or more bacteria growing with warm environments holding meat dishes. A lot of restaurants and buffets make sauces and slow cooked meats in advance and the kept temperature is probably not high enough to kill bad bacteria. \n\nEven when I was warned to not eat salad and vegetables at the Thai markets I didn\u2019t get sick. So I do wonder about higher levels of bacteria on meat kept warm for hours or days.\n\nAnyone I\u2019ve traveled with to Mexico who drank a ton of alcohol and ate every kind of meat and cheese at the buffet or at a restaurant off the resort was very sick for a few days. But they also really over did the drinking (bottled beer and margaritas) and food consumption.",
      "I stayed in Indo for over a month back in the late 90s and after week two was violently I\u2019ll with it coming out both ends at once. I ate lots of street food so I\u2019m guessing that was the culprit.",
      "That built up bacteria works wonders, or doesn\u2019t work at all! Every region has its own bacteria, I found India to not hurt my stomach. But Guatemala did, and what made it worse is my family is from there \ud83d\ude02 went there a ton and each time I\u2019d get sick. \n\nIn Mexico I also try and differentiate what kind of pains, spicy food naturally gives you the runs so I build a little mental tolerance for that. Same happened for me in south east Asia or other places where they ate spicy chilies \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f",
      "What part of Mexico are you traveling to? I've only been more into Mexico where my family is from, and have never gotten food poisoning. Are you eating at food stands? Is the food a lot spicier when you get it in Mexico? Like others have said stay away from tap water, only bottled drinks. You have some bad luck though, hope you're not eating at the same spots you've gotten sick at before.",
      "Only get sick from western food in Asia I found. \n\nEat local , stay healthy. Avoid shellfish.\n\nCan\u2019t talk for Mexico though as unfortunately I have never been.",
      "Only been to Mexico once but same for me! Have travelled all over SEA, been to Peru, Columbia, Panama, Carribbean...have eaten some dodgy shit but Mexico gave me my first food poisoning.",
      "You\u2019re not supposed to drink the water in Mexico, I\u2019d assume the same goes for any foods prepared with the water.",
      "I worked in San Luis Potosi, Mexico for about 5 years and the first two years I was plagued with a viscous cycle of digestive distraught.\n\nAfter blood testing, stool testing, an endoscopy, and a colonoscopy the root cause was bacteria. I would get sick from exposure to \"bad\" bacteria, take antibiotics, go back to Mexico, and get exposed again. It was horrible.\n\nThe solution ended up being the following:\n1. Diet - no uncooked food that are exposed such as lettuce, tomatoes, etc. Fruits with peeling were okay. No seafood. \n2. Daily Probiotic - constant intake of \"good\" bacteria.\n3. Daily Prilosec OTC - keep pH levels in the digestive system balanced for \"good\" bacteria.\n4. Daily Fiber Supplement - keeps things moving out of the body. Balanced out the lack of fiber in my diet down there.\n\nAfter following that regiment I never got sick again. Monitor your health pretty closely to keep yourself in balance. Hope this helps.",
      "Same!!!!!! I eat at the sketchiest places in Laos, the Philippines, China, Colombia, Ecuador etc and NEVER have any problems... In Mexico my boyfriend and me ate literally the SAME food, he never had any problems and I had food poisoning 3 different times, the last one was one of the worst sickness of my entire life, right up next to covid and stomach problems that had me ending up in a hospital for several days when I was 10...  Before Mexico I was bragging how strong my stomach is, at the end of our 3 month Mexico trip I refused to eat anything other than the mix your own salad at Chedraui.....",

The biggest symptom that is always showing up, are bowel cramps and they hurt like hell. Often they take about 1 to 2 weeks before things are getting normal. I believe it has more to do with my body getting used to new foods.",

With young kids and the next time with  friends. None of us had any issues with drinks, or food, or buffets. \n\nWe won\u2019t go back to Mexico by choice.

      "Country I've been to that I can't recommend enough: Thailand. Incredible scenic views, incredible food, great culture, friendly people. And I couldn't wrap my head around how cheap it was .\n\nCountry I'm currently planning to go to that I recommend: Vietnam. People generally say all the same things, but it's somehow half the cost of Thailand which is already cheaper than I could imagine.",
      "Go to Poland. Zakopane is a beautiful mountain region with delicious food.\n\nAll of Poland is generally cheap if you eat at the milk bars. Two people can eat for $12 usd  total at a milk bar. Very hearty dishes and cheap!",
      "Surprised I haven\u2019t seen many people mention Slovenia. We drove around Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj and were astonished by the similarities to Switzerland. Bovec was amazing too. Super affordable especially compared to Switzerland. Very good food as well. We paired with Croatia to get the best of both worlds.",
      "Nepal sounds like a good option. They have mountains, tigers and excellent food. Costs me about $15 a night for a hotel and $10 for a meal out.",
      "Don't know what kind of food you like and what time of year you're traveling (that makes a huge difference), but there's a whole lot of options in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central/South America... Including Puerto Rico. \n\nIf you're looking for further afield: Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, (Southern) India, Egypt (Red Sea cities), Turkey, Greece, Tunisia, and the Maldives (local islands) could be great options. Even Italy, France, or Malta seem inexpensive compared to California prices if you get good deals on flights (as long as you stay outside of super touristy cities/areas). \n\nYour definition of \"good food\" could be completely different from the next person's, so it's difficult to give you better advice without more info. Anyway compared to California, almost everywhere in the world that's warm will seem inexpensive. Maybe think about what views/atmosphere you'd like, which food you've got a taste for, and what the weather will be like when you're traveling. That should help you narrow down your options.",
      "In eastern and southern Europe, countries are not too expansive, the countries in the iberian peninsula like Portugal and spain seems nice i think, u Can get a night in an hotel for 20\u20ac and the general life like food, activities, IS not too expansive u Can easily stay and enjoy1 month, same for balkan countries idk about the Price for the plane because i live in France",
      "Philippines 100%. Currently here from the US. Food is 10/10 and cheap (7-course meal with 3 drinks included for 35$), cocktails are 2-6$ each. Beaches are the most beautiful i have seen, people are the most hospitable. Don't bother with Manila though, go to Siargao or if you have a family then Boracay.",
      "Bulgaria, my friends have just returned and good cheap food great people",
      "Georgia is hard to beat on food, views and prices.",
      "Japan isn't that expensive compared to pre-Covid times thanks to the depreciated Yen value. It's more affordable to do shopping there compared to back at home.\n\nThat said, Taiwan is also a great option on top of Japan. Great food, great views, great for your wallet.",
      "Japan and Thailand for sure! I initially thought Japan would be expensive but things changed once I landed there. Extremely affordable food, transport and accommodation. Absolutely loved the vibe there. \nThailand is even cheaper and I\u2019m currently typing this while enjoying my 50 baht phad Thai in Koh Tao.",
      "Poland. \n\nMountains in the south and sea in the North, excellent food, not very expensive, lovely cities, loads of history, and can be travelled fairly easily. Polish folk are amazing, and the country is great regardless of the season.",
      "Try Vietnam! Amazing food, affordable accomodation, lots of amazing views.",
      "$5k for 2 people for an international trip doesn't seem like a lot. That said, I went to Krak\u00f3w and Prague a couple years ago, was spending <$100/night on 4 and 5 star hotels in the city centers. This was the off season, like end of October, early November. Food was pretty good, lots of meat and potatoes, but can find whatever.",
      "Vietnam. Fabulous food and views",
      "Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia have mountains and are relatively cheap (especially Bosnia). A bit more pricey Greece and Portugal have even better food but also great scenery. Poland is also good for scenery especially in the south.\n\nCompared to Switzerland everywhere is cheap, except Iceland, in my experience.",
      "The Czech Republic is insanely cheap and Prague in particular is absolutely beautiful and full of delicious food. Of course, that also gives you the chance to take a train or bus into other nearby countries too. Romania is neat.\n\nSouthern Mexico (like Oaxaca) is really, really cool. There are two Michelin star restaurants there and the mountains are gorgeous. Everything is so cheap. The most expensive dish at one of the Michelin star restaurants cost the equivalent of $35, I think. Overall, it\u2019s a very different feel from the northeast where all the cruise ships go. I think the State Department safety rating is moderate right now. It feels pretty secure there. You could live like kings in some romantic spots for like $2,000, I bet.\n\nIf you\u2019re going full romantic, Italy is cheaper than you think. Greece is even cheaper but I\u2019ve always heard mixed things about it.",
      "Georgia is great especially if you travel outside Tbilisi to places like Kutaisi and Mestia awesome views great food and not expensive, just spent two weeks there and loved it.",
      "Balkans - nice food, great and stunning nature, very friendly people, everything is so cheap...\n\nWould recommend Poland also - food is great, has a lot of beautiful cities to offer like Krakow, Gdansk, Poznan...",
      "Japan is cheap right now but in general I\u2019d say Taiwan. The food isn\u2019t as good but there is quality nature. Public transport is strong as they were colonized by Japan. People there are lovely and the most friendly I\u2019ve met.",
      "I went to Greece recently (from the UK) and was blown away by how beautiful and surprisingly affordable it was. I don't know how much air fares cost from CA though. The people were super friendly (not just shopkeepers, I had lovely conversations with Greek people who were also on holiday on the same island) and there's so much to see and do. I'm also an anxious traveller (on my own with two kids) so feeling safe was a huge priority for me and I felt very safe in Greece. There were stunning beaches but maybe that's not a huge draw for you as you're from California but there's obviously loads of history and ancient culture to soak up as well as amazing (and affordable) food.",
      "This is absolutely true about Georgia (Sakartvelo). It\u2019s a treasure, not just a country. The food, people, wine, and scenery are all perfect and heartwarming.",
      "Any Balkan country, excellent food and there's an abundance of scenic views\n\nMacedonia\nSerbia\nMontenegro \nCroatia\nAlbania\nGreece\nSlovenia",
      "Macedonia, Bosnia, Serbia and Albania are cheap, have the best food in the world and the views are \ud83d\ude0d",
      "> that are not as expensive like switzerland or japan\n\nDo you mean for the flight tickets, or overall costs when at the destination?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSwitzerland is super expensive when at the destination, but not particularly expensive to travel to\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJapan on the other hand can be expensive to travel to, but things are **extremely** affordable once there!\n\nEverything is super cheap in price but outstandingly high in quality;\n\n* Food\n* Accommodations\n* Activities\n* Transportation\n* _you name it_\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI've been to Japan 3 times in 5 years and the flight ticket is by far the most expensive element - depending on my stay, the ticket alone was anywhere between 20 to 50% of my entire budget!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith 5000$USD you can easily fly to Japan (and back) and spend 3-6 weeks there with that budget",
      "I spent a month in Romania and only spent 850 USD while I was there (not including flights) I had great food the whole time and saw some really beautiful sights",
      "Bosnia & Herzegovina\u2026 massively underrated, easy to get to from most of Europe, good food, cheap, relatively untouristy, great people, amazing nature & scenery",
      "Portugal is fantastic and back in 2018 when I went it was a lot more affordable than Paris or Barcelona. But I would start with flights, if your budget is $5000 all in, see where you can get a good deal on flights and then do some subsequent research on hotels, food, excursions, etc. You are correct to cross Switzerland off that list.\n\nCentral or South America will also be quite a bit more affordable and not particularly hard to get to from CA. Have you considered Costa Rica? Peru? Argentina? I loved Colombia when I went but I have heard some not so great things post-covid.",
      "ROMANIA. Not necessarily great food (for vegetarians like me) but so beautiful with so many adorable villages and intact medieval architecture.",
      "Portugal is pretty cheap to fly from east coast USA. Lodging and food are also pretty cheap compared to Italy and France. I did a 8-9 day trip visiting Porto (famous for wine), Lisbon (capital), Cascais (Beach town), and Sintra (Castle town). English is spoken everywhere and I remembered 10-15minute uber ride costing around 5 USD. This was 2 years ago. It was very cheap for 3 people. Under 5000.",
      "Slovania and Slovakia,  amazing food and beautiful countryside.  Great wine too",
      "Bulgaria. Stunning scenery good cheap food, hot in summer, skiing in winter.",
      "Brazil! Went to Rio and while it was expensive to fly there, most things were very affordable. Especially food and ubers. The beaches and landscapes were some of the most beautiful places ive ever been.",
      "Argentina\n\nDollar has been strong recently due to high Argentinian inflation (although it\u2019s improving now). \n\nBuenos Aires has great food, culture, and architecture. For food, asados and choripan are unbeatable, just amazing. Everything is cheap. Nice studio 2 bed air bnb in central part of the city was $29 a night. Subway system is like 10 center per ride. \n\nAnd then you have Patagonia, so big and beautiful. An outdoors person\u2019s dream. Mountains, desert, valley, fields, winery\u2019s. \n\nI went to Bariloche in Patagonia Argentina. Feels more like Germany/Swizterland rather than Spain like the rest of the country does. 2 reasons: Architecture and chocolate. World record for largest chocolate bar. Oh, and Many Nazi\u2019s fled there after WW2. They even have Nazi History tours around the city. Interesting place. \n\nI also went to Iguazu falls in the north on the Brazilian border. South American version of Niagara Falls haha (it\u2019s huge I think it\u2019s bigger than Niagara) Very beautiful and a feel for the Amazon rainforest. \n\nArgentina is just great all around",
      "Portugal! The food was incredible and generally cheap, not to mention great prices on the local wine. You can stay in nice hotels for $200 USD or less per night in Lisbon. The train system is pretty easy to navigate and even the first class tickets are affordable. Get yourself out to the coast for some phenomenal views.",
      "Japan and Switzerland are completely different price levels.\n\nAnyway, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, India, Morocco, Georgia, Armenia, Turkey, Iran come to my mind.\n\nBeautiful sceneries but not so good food are found in the Philippines, Nepal, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Oman.",
      "Taiwan!! The best food i had in all of Asia, great history, scenic views and value for money!",
      "Brazil is much cheaper, if you earn in Dollars or Euros your currency is worth 5 times more in this country. You will find good food and the best experiences. For example, if you take an Uber, you may pay 5 dollars for a 10 to 20 minute trip.\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo is the most famous city in Brazil, you can see more information in this post: [https://roteirocidade.com/conhecendo-sao-paulo-em-4-dias/](https://roteirocidade.com/conhecendo-sao-paulo-em-4-dias/)",
      "Peru checks those boxes. Their food is sensational, the views are varied, and the culture is interesting. It's a quick (ish) flight for you, and you'll get a lot of bang for your buck.",
      "Peru, easy flight from CA, affordable, great food, variety of things to do. By the way, Japan is not expensive once there.",
      "Panama some what, might be lacking on the cuisine in some regards though. But if you're in the right town you'll be able to find usually a good sushi restaurant, pizza, things like that. I meant more so the Panamanian cuisine compared to other countries. But there are a lot of micro climates, so there is caribbean islands or lush higher altitude kind of rainforest mountain towns. Mexico, if you are open to staying in other parts other than CDMX, Tulum, Cabo, Cancun. Argentina is a good option as well, especially with 5k as a budget. I am also from CA and am used to spicy food. There isn't spicey food here but the food here is very very good, delicious steak, varieties of different parts of the cow to try, lots of good cheese, wines and desserts.\n\nThere is a lot of intensley beautiful mountain scenery here, lake regions where people vacation in the summer, there is skiing, hiking. You can splurge on restaurants here because fine dining restaurant here would cost you like 40-60 dollars and that's for 2 people. A 5 star luxury hotel with spa, pools, gym are 200 a night. Lots of variety of vineyard tours in Mendoza(the wine region). They have everything from budget tours to high end vineyard tours with catered 3 course meal to more rustic experiences that are vineyard tours on horseback followed by a traditional Argentine asado on the estancia. I came to visit some friends a year ago and haven't left haha. Just bare in mind the seasons are opposite here. We are currently leaving winter and heading into spring.",
      "From California I would suggest Indonesia or Philippines, they have some truly stunning scenery and at least for Indonesia really good food. Can\u2019t go wrong with Japan either but Indonesia will blow you away with mount bromo Komodo national park etc",
      "Peru is known for their food and their views and is very cheap.",
      "Cozumel, Mexico City, Spain, basically,  get away from the tourist spots.  You will get great food at reasonable prices.",
      "Bali. It's expensive to get there, but if you stay in the villages and not fancy resorts it's super cheap, great food and friendly people. I think I spent about $50 a day for hotel and food/drink.",
      "Ethiopia\n\nBeautiful country, great mountains for hiking, a desert with active volcanoes, ancient cities and welcoming people. Love their food!\nJust leave Addis Abeba as soon as possible. I got mugged there.",
      "Armenia comes to mind - the food is absolutely great, and the Mountain views of the lower Caucasus range with medieval monasteries in the foreground are some of the most scenic I\u2019ve seen. Pretty affordable as well",
      "Cape Town...cheap but terrific food and beautiful scenery outside the city areas",
      "So what kind of places do you like: cities; mountains; beaches; walking places? Indonesia is a huge country with diverse offerings: beaches (Bali; Lombok; \u2026), historic cities (yogyakarta); nature (Kalimantan for instance); food (everywhere but also padang on Sumatra); volcanos (all over but not on Kalimantan). I love the Indonesian food. And you can stay from cheap to expensive (up to your level of comfort).  Same story can be told for the Philippines, China, and probably many other countries in south east Asia.",
      "Bolivia is cheap and has incredible views and natural sceneries.\nRe: food, day to day food is a bit boring (and rarely vegetarian, if that\u2019s an issue), but in the towns you can find award winning restaurants at bargain prices",
      "I'm not sure about the prices now, but Hungary and specifically Budapest really surprised me 5 years ago, beautiful place and the food was exceptional. The beer was cheap and the tours were really interesting, you also have the massive advantage of access to a lot of other fantastic European cities with a short train ride. We came from Vienna and I think it took 2 hours but you could also visit Bratislava (3 hour journey).",
      "South east asia countries, indonesia, philipines, thailand, malaysia pretty much all have beutiful scenary, tons of activites, good food and for a very small price. Singapore is probably an exception since its more expensive, but it has cool things too and in terms of cost of living like public transport and food, I think its still cheaper than many other countries.",
      "Currently on Penang Island, Malaysia and it is amazing! Headed to Kuala Lumpur next then flying home to California. It is incredibly affordable, gorgeous views, stellar food, amazing culture. 10/10 would recommend. The flight over here can be expensive so definitely shop around, but once you\u2019re here you can enjoy great hotels/food/activities for very cheap. And with the beautiful oceanfront scenery would be very romantic!",
      "Thailand. Most of southeast Asia really but Thailand is.... Just perfect. It's exciting, to Americans it's cheap, the food is fantastic, and every day was an adventure.",
      "If beer counts as food - Czech Republic. Plus the pork dishes from the country are good as well.",
      "Thailand.   The only issue is that it is a brutal trip.  Doing in 5 days.   24 hours to get there and 24 hours back.\n\nBut Thailand has incredible food for a very reasonable price.",
      "Checkout south and Central America. Peru has amazing food.",
      "East and Southeast Asia can be spectacular and very cheap (with very good food and accommodations for less than most of the world). 10 years ago I would have recommended China, hands-down, but sadly now I have to recommend against it because of the current political climate, restrictions on movement, and challenges with an obtuse payment system that is nearly impossible for tourists to use comfortably. Vietnam can be spectacular and so can Laos. Cambodia is an amazing country to explore, too. All three have incredible food (so fresh!), breathtaking natural vistas, and unique histories that can make your trip more memorable.",
      "Mexico seems like the obvious choice here. There are plenty of places to go, but even CDMX is pretty cheap and has some of the best food in the world. It would only be cheaper in other places (not counting resorts).",
      "Colombia my guy.  Absolutely breathtaking beauty. Insane food, not that expensive. A great combo-bombo",
      "Like I've seen others post up, SEA is a great place to start. Thailand is extremely cheap outside of the peak season - which ironically does not include northern hemisphere summer - to the extent that my fiancee and I were able to plan two full weeks of travel across three high tourist areas (Bangkok, Chiang Mai/Chiang Dao, and Phuket) for less than 3000 USD total. Roundtrip international flights ran about 800 pp, great hotel stays ran us about 400 per five days, and food and transit were extremely cheap basically everywhere.",
      "I haven't visited Vietnam yet but it is on my to-do list. As per my own research, Vietnam is less expensive, beautiful, and also offers world good food.\n\nWhat do you think about it?",
      "Peru has some of the best views in the America\u2019s and is also known for its food",
      "Japan is the only right answer IMHO; Safe, inexpensive, tonnes of stuff to do for every kind of person, and naturally the food is phenomenal",
      "Croatia was brilliant stuck to the coastline beautiful views and really inexpensive food was excellent definitely on my return to list.",
      "Nepal \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf5\n\nBeautiful scenery, you can do a lot of hiking and get some stunning mountain views.\n  \nLots of temples, festivals, culture.\n\nYou can do a Safari in the national park, almost guaranteed to see rhinos as well as other wildlife.\n\nWe loved the food, everything from local restaurants to western food and a budding coffee shop culture.\n\nEverything is super affordable.",
      "How long is your trip? $5k is a pretty solid budget for 2 weeks almost anywhere in the world except the Carribean, US or Western Europe (ex Portugal which is pretty cheap and I'd recommend!)\n\nI'm gonna throw China's Yunnan province into the mix. Best food I've ever had in my life, stunning scenery, friendly locals, very safe and you'd struggle to even spend half your budget there. Tiger leaping Gorge, Lijiang and Dali were all stunning.",
      "Medellin, Columbia is about 30% cheaper than comparable things in Atlanta. Food and drinks were just incredible all around and I would gladly go back any time",
      "Czech Republic. Great food, **super cheap**, and everyone was really nice. Ive been a few times to a few different cities and never had a bad time.",
      "Northern Ireland is much cheaper than Ireland and the rest of the UK. I would not say that the food is world class but the camaraderie in the pubs will certainly make up for it. And it is ridiculously scenic. That northern coast is stunning.",
      "Croatia!  Friendly people, beautiful coastline and very reasonably priced food and hotel.  Highly recommend!",
      "Vietnam, Da Nang, beautiful beaches surrounded by mountains. Great food and people. About half an hour away from Hoi An.",
      "I cannot recommend Guatemala enough. Incredibly gorgeous, both the country and its people. Lots of culture and history and consistently the best food I have had in my life. My dollar went pretty far there."

In Genoa you get pesto and foccacia. Scotland and Ireland is fish and chips.  The French see no reason to eat ethnic food on a regular basis. A medium size city may have just on or two SE Asian restaurants. we are blessed to have such a variety of different restaurants within 10 miles.",
      "Currently we are in the middle of planning a roadtrip from San Francisco to LA and San Diego for Xmas. \n\nFor me its mostly BBQ and steak related things and sweet stuff like pancakes and donuts. Which i know i like already. Plus in n out burger and good mexican food, which i have never really tried yet. \n\nBut my fianc\u00e9e is an asian living in europe, where there isnt enough good asian food for her. So we'll probably eat chinese, japanese and korean at least half of the time (which i also like a lot, just wouldnt so much associate with america/california).",

Jack in the Box, in n out, 5 guys, carls jr, taco bell, del Taco, chipotle, fat burger, the list goes on and on. \n\nNow mainly the bbq, brisket, tritip or pulled pork. \n\nBut I also have to say, nowadays I feel really a Lack of good restaurants for a fair price. In big cities there are usually a couple options but otherwise you really depend on either fast food and mediocre chains, super expensive restaurants or cooking yourself. \n\nI love the US for the national parks and for Roadtrips. But what holds me off from chosing the US as travel destination is really the food. Its a shame that it almost always feels industrialized and unhealthy/ uninspiring. A Lot of food is a not so great copy of other countries food."

It wasn't bad in any sense, but having been to e.g. Vienna, Prague, and a bunch of other cities in the region it just didn't stand out that much.

Despite the gorgeous scenery and the incredible hospitality of the local populations however the food has been awful. Of course, these are remote regions with limited agriculture and wide-spread poverty, but even in some of the more fertile and accessible parts of e.g. Tajikistan you'd be lucky to find more than the same 2-4 dishes done more or less well.\n\nAny place in particular that stood out to you on either side of the scale?

If anyone offers you a \"Very special dish\", just pass on it. Even the bread they serve with food is awful. Think naan with no flavor. \n\nEgypt.

In Egypt, it looks gross and is gross. Stick to Lebanese food while you're here. Addendum: Cairo is not for the fragile.

Everything was really fresh and simple but perfect. \n\nI had the same experience in Budapest, they had a lot more modern & varied cuisine than Vienna at the time and it was such a nice change. I also found the people friendlier! Had a lovely conversation with a Hungarian antique shopkeeper in German, when the Viennese equivalent would barely deign to speak with me.",

But you go to these countries to see the amazing wildlfe, and some of the culture, so no worries. \n\nWhen I was in New Zealand in the 90's, the food was awful and expensive, but wow, is it incredibly gorgeous. \n\nFor great food and not much else, I would have to say Singapore.

      "I loved Indonesia but I was not impressed by the food compared to other SEA countries.\n\nAny European country north of the Alps and east of the Rhine has great sights but disappointing food.\n\nI think Singapore has so much food to offer and I loved the Food Markets but the country per se is not an exciting place to visit and the climate is horrendous.",
      "I dont know if this will be what you are looking for but Thailand was amazing for both. Delicious food everywhere, 8$ best massages you can get, awesome people and great scenery. \n\nThe only awful thing about it was the time it took to get there and how little time I had there. And bangkok was stinky.",
      "great despite the food: brazil was great despite the food, which pretty much just consisted of a mountain of meat, potatoes, and rice. lao food was also pretty bland but the country itself was great to visit. netherlands is a beautiful country but their cuisine seems to be herring and mayonnaise. \n\ni didn\u2019t love moldova, but the food and wine was really good. i\u2019d go back just for the wine.",
      "I enjoyed vacationing in the United Kingdom, particularly in Scotland. But the only way I survived food-wise was by eating at \"Curry Houses\", which is apparently what they call Indian and related restaurants (it appeared to be a catch-all name, whether the owners were Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan etc.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe single worst meal I've been offered in my entire life was from a local pub in Milton Keynes. I don't remember the name, but it was across the street from a Burger King near Bletchley Park. To be fair, my dish wasn't British. I had already learned to avoid British food, so I ordered lasagna. But lasagna is not supposed to be gray and devoid of color. It was not edible.  \n\n\nI don't think I've traveled anywhere where the food was the only good thing. But the best food I've had in my travels so far was in Thailand. However, Thailand was awesome overall.",
      "Despite the food: Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, Poland, Oman, Myanmar, Panama",
      "Norway: the most naturally beautiful place I\u2019ve ever been but not a culinary wonderland at all. The food isn\u2019t awful per se, but certainly bland and overpriced. The only things that are cheap are hot dogs and pre-frozen meals. Great coffee though.\n\nFor the opposite I might say Georgia (the country): it\u2019s a beautiful and fascinating place but it just felt rude and unwelcoming and the infrastructure is quite poor. That said the food (both simple things like cheeses and breads, khachapuri, khinkali, etc. as well as complex dishes with eggplant, pomegranate, nuts, spices, etc.) is incredible, and so is the local wine and beer.",
      "I\u2019ll throw one out - I live in Thailand and I hate the food. Not only am I allergic to all seafood & fish sauces, but when I do get something that is free from those it\u2019s cooked in so much oil and sugar it\u2019s impossible to enjoy. \n\nFor the flip side: I absolutely LOVE the local cuisine of Indonesia. Tempeh ALL DAY EVERY DAY and although I\u2019m not Vegan, it\u2019s easy to acquire vegan/vegetarian dishes that ACTUALLY aren\u2019t made with fish sauce\u2026 but everyone I\u2019ve travelled with there HATES THE FOOD.\n\nEdit: to add.. Mongolian food in winter is horrible. Horse jerky dumplings were the most palatable thing I ate.",
      "Amsterdam. I was like \"what kind of food are they known for?\" And I was told fries. I actually went there because I was visiting friends in Germany and we met with some other friends visiting and they all wanted to go to Amsterdam for different reasons (one was an avid cyclist, the other was a druggie). I actually very much enjoyed the art museums and architecture. Food was meh, but who knows I may have just missed out on any really good food. Germany had great food, though."

      "Ho chi minh city in Vietnam hands down. I can walk one block and within that block I\u2019ll have delicious entree, dessert, appetizer, and coffee. Some from restaurant/vendors and some from carts. All cheap. I call it the dollar store of eating. Most carts serve things ranging around $1 including entrees. Appetizer, entree, dessert, and coffee or boba you can get all for $5. No tipping either. Super quick service. Sit down, yell out your order, eat, then pay for your meal by asking/yell to pay again. I can get in and out in less than ten minutes at most simple eateries. A server in America might put your order in at the 10 minute mark. \n\nFood delivery is so cheap it doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. It costs $1 fee plus $1 tip. You can save up to an hour driving back and forth and it\u2019ll only cost $2 if you opt for delivery. I can have a thanksgiving spread full of home made meals by the pool, at the park, or in my dining room for $20 within the hour. \n\nThere\u2019s so many restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City that each restaurant needs to cook really well or else their business would fail. Im a huge fan of food stalls. At my hotel in the city you can walk the block for breakfast and then for dinner and the stalls would change out completely to new vendors and dishes. It\u2019ll be different again late night with new dishes. So much good food. Everything is so cheap",

Don\u2019t be squeamish about bugs,   Just give it a go.  \n\n- Japan.   Perfect place to try artisan foods,   Really get to the origin of the country.  The fermented foods really do go down a treat.  \n\n- Sri Lanka. If you love fresh fruit and vegetables this is a must for any food lover.     Forget about coffee, tea is the only way to go.   And also the king coconuts, are refreshing on a hot day.   Must try\u2019s:  octopus, chocolate cake and the way the locals drink tea.  \n\n- China. Another place you can\u2019t go wrong.    If you like spicy but flavourful. Then china is the way to go.  Lots to tempt you.  \n\n- India. Rather odd in some ways, but great too.  Think past the curry\u2019s and go for what the locals snack on.   The ice cream in bread is a bit unusual,   But when in Rome as they say.     \n\nLooking forward to what others say.",

Just make sure you\u2019re not eating from street carts and you\u2019ll be fine.",
      "Sri Lanka.\n\nI may be a little biased here, but I think we honestly have some great and unique food.\n\nFor example, I think our cuisine uses more coconut than any other in the world. If you love coconuts, that's a place you must visit. Basically, our curries are coconut cream curries, we have our sambola (type of sambal) that's basically scraped coconuts and chili, lots of leafy greens prepared with scraped coconuts, and also stuff like rotis made with scraped coconuts and four. \n\nThen we have some of the spiciest top level curries. In my opinion, we make the best pork in the world - it has to be wild boar, the spicy curry is out of this world. Same with Jaffna Crab Curry, which I think is simply the best crab dish in the world hands down.\n\nAnd all these for a dime.

      "I would go with the Netherlands.\n\nI moved here and it's really difficult to find good quality, tasty food. Why I say so? Because locals have very low standards. We went to several \"authentic\" places with high ratings and thousands of happy customers, only to realize that the food tastes nothing like truly authentic food (we would be okay if it was even average). Thus, you can find good places only by word of mouth, only from people who traveled and tried good stuff. I am a big foodie, and I love trying new stuff, but in NL, we got disappointed so many times that I really stopped trying. \n\nBtw I have a similar approach when I travel (doing decent research about local food culture, finding nice places/bakeries/markets to eat, avoiding tourist traps), and I never had the problem like in NL.",

Beautiful country, wonderful people, pretty terrible food. \n\nThere\u2019s some Japanese/Korean inspired restaurants that aren\u2019t too terrible, but even they\u2019re a bit disappointing because Mongolians have to take all the spice out of anything.\n\nTraditional Mongolian food is not good. Buuz and khuushuur (types of dumpling) are quite nice but they don\u2019t constitute a full meal. Most other Mongolian food is just some variant of sinewy and fatty mutton served with not much else.\n\nI\u2019m complaining, because I didn\u2019t go to Mongolia for the food, but it does stand out as the worst I\u2019ve experienced.",

Best Chinese, ramen and of course pubs I\u2019ve ever had. Just expensive for an American. Disappointing: Boston. Some decent pubs, but hard to find anything else, even pizza, or worse, McDonald\u2019s. Literally hard to find a McDonald\u2019s in Boston. Also hardly any delivery options. As a Californian, Boston is very disappointing food wise. Cantina in Logan Airport had surprisingly amazing chips with salsa, guacamole and queso. Sad when airport food is the highlight.",

      "Amsterdam. One of my friends warned me that the food is not good there before going but holy shit the food is bad there. I went to Foodhallen based off recs here and online and it was not good at all. 4 of us picked a few different restaurants and none of us like anything in particular. I know a lot of it is selling to drunk/high tourists but the chicken/bacon/pizza hotdog was akin to a minor war crime. The fresh Stroopwaffel was out of this world and I'm upset that the poffertjes machine wasn't working the day I went to carousel. Amsterdam is amazing, go visit it, but the be prepared for not great food or go for other ethnicities (I had great Ramen and my friends really liked an argentinian restaurant they went to). I lived in a caribbean country that is ruled by Holland so my expectations were a little bit higher than they should have been. I kinda want to open a Creole restaurant in Amsterdam now",

Disappointing after experiencing the fantastic street food in Mexico.\n\nI felt like Istanbul had pretty disappointing food for how many damn spices were on display. Not as flavorful as I\u2019d expect.\n\nPortugal felt like a worse Spain/Italy for food.",
      "Costa Rica\u2026 maybe it was just the places I visited but, while the food wasn\u2019t bad, there seemed to be few \u201cauthentic\u201d options for food. Instead I kept finding Italian food wherever I went. Which is fine but I\u2019m from Italy so its never gonna be that good compared to the real thing. \n\nI did find a couple dishes that I really liked and the fresh fruit was great. But overall not somewhere I\u2019d go back to for the food. Unbelievably beautiful though!",

      "I could not get over how bad the food was in the Philippines. This surprised me as all the Filo food I've had at friends places I enjoyed!",
      "TBH, Trinidad and Tobago wasn't amazing. That said, I was staying in Castara, not Port of Spain, where there's only 5 or so restaurants. And I just watched a Mark Wiens video where he was literally in Castara and the food looked great, so maybe I just got unlucky on that trip.",
      "I\u2019m going to be controversial and say that the food in Rome left me disappointed and not full! Everyone raves about Italian cuisine, authentic pizza and suchlike \u2026 perhaps I picked bad restaurants, but I found most things very bland.\n\nGambian cuisine is some of my favourite \u2026 I love peanuts, so the domoda dish (which is essentially meat in peanut sauce) is to die for. \n\nThe street food in Singapore is amazing and so reasonably priced\u2026 I would take the 16-hour flight back there just to spend my time eating at hawker markets.\n\nSalt cod in Portugal \u2026 kleftiko in Greece \u2026 ice cream drizzled with olive oil in Croatia (seriously, better than it sounds) \u2026 I could go on, being as my brain is situated in my stomach most of the time! \ud83d\ude0b",
      "Not so much a \"destination\" but rather a region- \n\nBut basically the entire USA Midwest. \n\nHaving lived in the Midwest for over a decade and travelled A LOT all over the region, I can definitely attest that the food sucks. \n\nWhile youll find a local gem here and there, depending on the state/location, it's mostly garbage. \n\nIt's mainly chain restaurants for which do not use fresh local foods. \n\nOver the course of my years in the Midwest, most of the independent places that popped up with excellent food, went out of business rather quickly.\n\nBest bet is to find a major city and research for a good restaurant",

      "Peru. Lomo saltado is extremely overrated to me and most of the other food was overall average. Except chupe de camarones in Arequipa, that stuff is fire",
      "Rome. \nRome has great food, do not get me wrong, however unlike many cities in Europe I found Rome to be extremely hit or miss.",
      "A place I was happily surprised: China.\n\nBeing a vegetarian, I went into the trip thinking I was going to be living on the protein bars I had packed, but wow - some of the best food I\u2019ve ever had while abroad was in Shanghai. So many incredible sauces and spices. You need to be cautious/pass when it comes to eating anything fresh (ie salads, raw vegetables - bc of the water quality) but otherwise, my exceptions were exceeded!!",
      "Germany - repulsive. Had high hopes but nothing is seasoned very much (at all). Beer and snacks are good\u2026\n\nGreece has the best food I\u2019ve had while traveling. Very good seasoning \n\n- US traveler",
      "Costa Rica. Kind of expected flavorful amalgam of Mexican and Central American cuisine. Very bland and boring food. That said, nature Costa Rica is absolutely gorgeous and there is so much to see and do.",
      "Greece!  It's not objectively bad but relative to expectations it wasn't great - went in expecting something akin to the food I'd eaten in Turkey, or even Italy, but founded it to be the blandest version of that.  \n\nThe ingredients were fresh but the end result wasn't the gustatory delight I had wished for.\n\nSpent most of our time in Crete so maybe that's a factor as we had surprisingly good pizza, baked goods and high-end dining in Athens.",
      "Quintana Roo, Mexico, by far the most disappointing. All the food I\u2019ve had elsewhere in Mexico has been amazing.",
      "Peru. Generally shitty seafood, market places absolutely reek, food was pretty bland and all the veggies made me sick. If I see another Maize plant I\u2019m gonna be sick",
      "Spain. Been twice and only enjoyed the olives and the wine. My friend explained Spanish food as France\u2019s week old leftovers. Stale and flavorless.",

      "Should be obvious but Costa Rica has bland food",

      "This will upset some people, but the food I\u2019ve had in Italy over the past 3 weeks has mostly just been ok. \nDid have a great steak in Florence, and really good Wild Boar, braised in wine and tomatoes, in Orvieto. Half of the rest of it has been good, but not OMG good, and the remaining half just ok. \nNothing really bad, but nothing that me say WOW either.",
      "Peruvian food was a pleasant surprise!",

      "Best food = Mexico, anywhere\n\nWorst food = Miami",
      "I visited Malta and food was among other things that disappointed me.",
      "For me personally, when I travelled to Italy in 2015, my family and I found like a good 75% of the food super underwhelming. Going off google reviews and trip advisor didn't cross our minds much then. \nI know some of it is our own fault. We now when travelling we do some research beforehand and we never just walk into a place willy nilly. \nI want to go back because I know it would be way better with what I've learned since, but at that time, we had some really mediocre food.",
      "Serbia or the balkans in general.\n\nUnless you enjoy meat thats half raw (sausages, burgers and chicken), with bread. Then it'll be heaven for you.\n\nI'm convinced people are thin there because they have constant food poisoning. Dear god the shits you take there will smell worse than you can imagine. It's not helped by the fact that a lot of hotels are old and have toilets that have a ledge to catch your poop instead of just dumping it in the water. So you have to stand there with your shower head trying to blast the most foul smelling stuff on the planet into the water. Its like the shitiest carnival game ever.\n\nOh and the toilets DO try to blast the poop that is super glued into the water when you flush, but this frequently just creates a fountain of water in your bathroom. Its like a waterfight you can't afford to lose. You can put the lid down but the seat still gets soaked.\n\nIn short the reason bathrooms there all have drains on the floor is that you're literally constantly having to hose down your toilet after use.",
      "Senegal. Surprisingly bland and crazy amounts of oil used in everything. (Honorable mention: the mangoes. Best I ever had.) Best food? South Africa. They know how to curry.",
      "Italy. I guess I am use to American-ized Italian food. Sure had some good meals, but overall bland and disappointing",
      "Sicily. While some of it was good (ie seafood and fresh vegetables), I was amazed how bad most of it was (arincini, gelato con brioche, etc).",
      "No offense to anyone out there - for me it was Brazil. So disappointing. I\u2019m a vegetarian and was surprised that such a lush beautiful country that could grow lots of produce didn\u2019t have any decent tasty vegetarian dishes. \n\nAlso, Germany with respect to German cuisine. I ended up eating food from other cuisines while there.",
      "Glastonbury Festival, 2007. I had been going to festivals since 2001, but took a while to build up to the big one; was previously used to festival food that was shit and overpriced (looking at you, \u201cUltimate Burger\u201d Leeds Fest 2003). Glastonbury was a revelation. Global street food everywhere, amazing quality, massive variety, absolutely blew my mind.\n\nThese days, it\u2019s fairly standard for that to be the case at British festivals, the bar has raised so far, but back in 2007 it felt revelatory.",
      "Cuba. Communism ruined it. No one can own boats so there wasn\u2019t that much fish. The grocery stores had like seven items. Dark rum clear rum a meat boxed pasta canned olives and soda were most. I did not see a Cuban sandwich. A lot of pasta and food with olives",
      "Food in Melbourne, Australia is strange. The CBD is filled with overpriced, mediocre chinese food, catered to international students. I remember paying $32AUD for a bowl of noodle that\u2019s just hot chilly oil and 3 slices of meat. The Carlton surburb just a bit north of the CBD is in similar fashion but for Italian food. I have the same thought everytime I eat there: \u201cI can make this at home for a fraction of the cost, and better, why am I here?\u201d most patrons are regional tourists too.",
      "I wasn't blown away by Kenyan food.",
      "From what I can remember, Irish food left something to be desired. We found the occasional good restaurant, but otherwise I don\u2019t think it was anything special. \n\nOn the flip side, I\u2019ve had some of the best meals of my life in Guatemala, Peru, and England (London).",
      "The EPCOT wine and food festival. I was genuinely surprised at how bad, how expensive, and how over lackluster it was.",
      "Iceland. \n\nThe lamb was out of control but everything else was ordinary and extremely expensive. To be fair it\u2019s not really a foodie location but I was expecting more on the seafood end. There were a few highlights tho",
      "I was disappointed by the food in Morocco. It was much blander than I expected.",
      "The Galapagos. Like an idiot, I had thought there would be great seafood because it's in the middle of the ocean, but it is all protected and no fishing allowed. So everything is flown or shipped in, except for the plantains and some other produce that they grow on the island. Oh yeah, and the chickens that roam the streets.  Breakfast was okay. But after that visit, I could never eat a plantain again. They put them in everything there. Yuck. Can't stand them.",
      "Italy. \nFood wasn\u2019t bad like it was in Colombia or the UK, but very bland, and my expectations were higher. Did a lot of research and asking around with locals/going to popular spots, and all, to no avail.",
      "Ireland can be frustrating.  Individually they have some of the best food in Europe.\n\nTheir dairy, meat and vegetables are incredible but I think they fail badly when putting them into a dish.\n\nVegetables are often boiled to death with no seasoning,  steaks seem to be over to be over done than requested and unless your in a restaurant that specialises in international food they all have the same things on their menus.",
      "The best food I've ever tasted was in Colombia. It wasn't necessarily the traditional Colombian food - there's nothing wrong with Colombian dishes, but it was the Indian and Italian and burgers. All the food you wouldn't expect to be particularly memorable were, in fact, the most delicious dishes I've ever eaten in my life.",
      "Costa Rica. All the guide books warned me how bland all the food was there. But it was still so shocking to me given how good the food is in neighboring latin countries. One can only eat so much arroz con pollo. I did have one really memorable meal there. The chef was a former cruise ship chef and made a great steak with chimichurri sauce.",
      "Salzburg. I was there in August (I think) and while I love a schnitzel and the general pub food when I went for more seasonal things it was quite underwhelming.",
      "Disneyland Paris. I mean it's Paris, the food is gonna be good right? Wrong. It was some of the worst theme park food. To be fair though I went in knowing that after watching a lot of YouTube videos. \n\nI was really surprised by London. Man there was so much good food. I'm still dreaming about humble crumble, definitely worth the social media hype.",
      "Greece was disappointing to me.   I love Greek - American cuisine but authentic Greek food was disappointing.",
      "It\u2019s not why you\u2019re going there, but the food options in and around Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon are really, really mediocre. That\u2019s a diet vacation.",
      "Argentina and Chile both have amazing food!",
      "Morocco - I loved Morocco but the food just wasn\u2019t what I would have expected. Flavorless and bland",
      "Guatemala and Croatia/Serbia/Slovenia have the least interesting food of all the places I\u2019ve traveled.",
      "Turks and Caicos. Best food on the island was at a restaurant that was not advertised at all. Only learned about it through a local. The main restaurants that were advertised as the best or good were terrible and expensive.",
      "Croatia: the food in Dubrovnik was terrible and town overrun with tourists. Hvar we had some of the best food on our trip and we went to Germany, Italy, and Austria",
      "Cuban food in Cuba.",
      "New Zealand. There were some restaurants on the vineyards of Waiheke Island that were great (Tantalus, Cable Bay, etc) and Gibbston Valley vineyard on South Island, but everywhere else the food was pretty bland. Oh, and this one cheapie Malaysian takeaway spot in Wellington. We had that laksa twice. \n\nNZ beer was pretty dull too. Again, Wellington had one decent craft beer place and my husband and I got like super flights so we tried at least 6 different beers and just meh.  I stuck with wine after. \n\nIn short, NZ is all about natural beauty and outdoor activities. Good food can be found at wineries though.",
      "Food in Cuba - has nothing to do with the \u201ccuban\u201d food you find in the US, no spices; no nada. And if you\u2019re a tourist chances are you will be bored of ropa vieja, rice, beans omg.\n\nFood in Morocco - guys ffs, how can restaurants only have tagine and pastilla on their menu?! how? I have had moroccan housemates, and their cooking was great, thoroughly good food, but visiting the country was one dissapointing culinary (and more) experience.\n\nFood in Colombia - it\u2019s just bland\n\nFood in the Netherlands - some of the most ugh food I\u2019ve tasted, like not only the traditional one, but also the international one. Though I would like a Stroopwafel once in a while yas pls.\n\nOh the omg so good side:\n\nMexico - though some take some getting used to, very complex flavours and some I just cannot do; but some tacos al pastor any day; some marquesitas uuuh yes\n\nItaly - they know their stuff; all them pastas pizzas, piadellas, tigellas, and omg gnocci fritti\n\nIsrael - this was genuinely a surprise; maybe I got lucky, but food was consistently fresh and really cooked as it should be; good balance of everything\n\nJapan - even the 7-eleven can be a feast; a bento box on the train better than some restaurants; always good. spend 2 months there, have not had ONE bad meal.",
      "I don't have money to get that good good but the food in Paris was so lackluster. Absolutely flavorless. I found it easier to go to the grocery store instead of a restaurant. Although I did get fried goat cheese covered in honey at a place near Notre Dame and that was pretty damn good.",
      "Switzerland. The most beautiful place I\u2019ve seen in my life but God the food was so bland and stale. Except maybe the fondue and chocolates, nothing was worth the price. \n\nGreece. Also incredibly beautiful and extremely crowded. But the food? WOW. I was blown away by the simple, cheap and amazing food at every little restaurant. Not to mention the people there are so kind, friendly and helpful. For example, the restaurant owner will gladly arrange a cab for you to go back to your hotel if it is far. Best food I had in Europe."

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve never been able to finish the huge portions that restaurants tend to serve, and that tends to be the case in any country I go to. \n\nI\u2019m in central Africa right now, eating at the hotel restaurants as part of a package deal that the travel company covers.  The portions are too big for me to finish, and they often include a salad or other raw vegetable. \n\nSince the tap water isn\u2019t safe to drink and I don\u2019t want to risk food poisoning, I don\u2019t eat the raw vegetables.  I eat what I can until I\u2019m full, but honestly it\u2019s more than I can eat, and more calories than I want. \n\nWhen the server comes to take the plate away, I\u2019ve noticed a look on their faces that indicates dissatisfaction or irritation.  I can understand this\u2014 they may have struggled with food insecurity before and many of the people around the area are too poor to get enough food. Remember your parents telling you to clear your plate, there are starving children in Africa?  It hits a bit different when you are actually here. And the kitchen worked really hard on the food.  Yet here I am not eating all of it. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t want to risk food poisoning by eating raw vegetables that might have been washed with untreated tap water. And I don\u2019t want to consume unwanted calories when I am trying to lose some weight.  \n\nI\u2019ve tried asking for less food but the language barrier makes it difficult to communicate that. \n\nMy travel companion feels that I am being overly cautious by not eating the salads (they have been to dozens of developing countries and eat raw vegetables without issues) and that I should just clear more of my plate regardless of how full I am. \n\nI\u2019m curious to know other travelers thoughts on this.",

      "You\u2019re right to be cautious about the salad and raw veg\n\nBesides that, I think you\u2019re reading too much into a facial expression. Maybe they\u2019re offended you didn\u2019t eat their salad. Maybe they\u2019re just grumpy in general. At a restaurant (especially one that caters to international travelers) you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about eating only what you want. Peer pressure (much less imagined peer pressure) is a really dumb way to get food poisoning",
      "Here's what I've done in the past. If I know for sure there's an element of the meal I'm not going to touch, I'll request them not to include it at all. \n\nUsually they'll agree but will also let you know that you'd still have to pay the same price. That's acceptable to me. Some sides like raw salads are complimentary and not charged anyway, also served separately. So you can just totally ask them to take those dishes away as long as you haven't touched them - before you begin eating. They shouldn't have any problem doing this. \n\nWhen the portion size is too large, I'll just ask them to pack up the remnants for me to take home and eat later. Obviously, you've got to make sure it's in a fit condition to be packed (still in the serving dish, for instance, rather than on your plate and half-eaten). This is a common practice in my part of the world. Even upscale restaurants here will offer this service and it's usually complimentary.\n\nFor reference I live in India.\n\nIf you're eating at someone's home, let them know in advance that you tend to eat less and will help yourself as you go along, and that you'd prefer not to waste the food they prepared for you. In many parts of the world it's a common custom for the host to insist the guest eat more. It's one way to show love and concern. You are free to politely excuse yourself, multiple times if you have to. This back and forth of \"come on, take one more\" and you saying \"oh I'm so full already\" and them insisting \" you simply must\" and you saying \"I really wish but I'm about to burst\"... It's all part of the experience. As long as you say something like \"I'm so full already, it was excellent and I ate a ton. No thank you I'd love to but I just can't\".. Or \"I'm saving space for dessert\"... They'll eventually relent. Don't feel compelled to accept every time they offer. I only mention this because a lot of people from other cultures don't know that there is an acceptable way to refuse, as long as you do it politely and compliment them all the way.",
      "It\u2019s very good attitude. I was traveling with guided tour in Danakil desert, Ethiopia. And a few Americans started playing with bottle water. Like spraying at each other and even spilled some on the ground. And this water was brought to us by jeeps and camels. Local people have very limited amount of water there. So it\u2019s better to overreact a bit than be ignorant. \nCould you try asking smaller plate of food in advance next time?",
      "I'm relatively impervious to food poisoning with a couple notable exceptions (poisoned myself by leaving pasta alfredo out overnight and got poisoned by a sushi place by weirdly enough the lobster salad) and will generally not be that cautious about ice cubes and opening my mouth in the shower and the like and some of my favorite dining experiences abroad have been eating chicken cooked by the side of the highway over an oil drum.\n\n>My travel companion feels that I am being overly cautious by not eating the salads (they have been to dozens of developing countries and eat raw vegetables without issues) \n\nI swear, EVERY single person I know that's gotten food poisoning abroad has gotten ended by a salad or other raw veggies, including a professor of mine who was a vegetarian when she accompanied some people to Venezuela and wound up both getting Dengue (not food borne) and Hep A (definitely food borne) \\*simultaneously\\*.  The only difference between her and the students was they were eating street meat and she ate salad.  Her liver took a pretty nasty hit.  I even tend to avoid them while being far more willing to eat something like ceviche (no, the lime juice does not cook a lot of virulent bacteria out) since fish tends to be more carefully handled than lettuce.",
      "After 5 years living in Africa myself. I say:\n\n\\- Don't eat the raw vegetables if you haven't done extensive travel in the region previously to build up your immunity\n\n\\- Depending on where you are, ennui and disinterest among service staff is just how it is. People don't get paid much, are afraid to fuck up lest they get fired/docked pay, and there isn't a customer service or tipping culture so people are just collecting a paycheck.\n\n\\- In a lot of African cultures people chow down when it's on someone else's dime (including a full board hotel) and the hospitality service matches (you see lots of buffets). If you just say something like \"in my culture we don't eat as much at one sitting\" people I think will understand. People are also protective of their own culture / skeptical of changing their habits so if you are the same it won't be seen as weird, if that makes sense.\n\n\\- Don't assume people will want your leftovers or that the restaurant is doing anything with them. If you want ask for a takeaway box and give it to someone who's really destitute.\n\nLastly, hotels are often kind of lousy in terms of food. Don't be afraid to go out and experience street markets or the restaurant scene if you're in a big city.",
      "My girlfriend is Venezuelan and it's a big debate between us. I believe you stop eating when your body tells you - where to her wasting food is the worst thing possible. We have both probably gained 6-7 kilos in the past few years together.\n\nWe've found ways to compromise - we try to pack up left overs for homeless here in Colombia. She's also been taking classes with a nutritionist to reframe how she looks @ food. It's a complicated situation I respect.\n\nNeither of us have a problem getting sick from vegetables, street food, water etc. luckily.\n\nAnother thing we do now is split an entree and maybe an appetizer. Or if it's a simple restaurant that doesn't offer menu choices, order 1 meal and then get a small treat somewhere else afterwards. Portion sizes here are really big like the old days - but w modern work on the computer we can't burn the calories.",
      "Ethiopia. Huge plate of zil zil tibs (grilled steak chunks with hot peppers). Probably the best I've ever had. Been there 3 times, never had tibs like this again. So great. Anyway. It was a huge plate and I struggled to finish it. I made it a point to finish it because I was in Ethiopia. The waiter comes out to grab our plates and sees mine empty and goes off on how rude HE is because he didn't give me enough food. Yells to the kitchen. He brings out another plate. Fuck. I ate so much steak that day. It was the most delicious steak, but it was soooo much. On the second plate I left a couple of pieces. Oh man, thanks for making me remember that.",
      "In places where I'm worried about food safety, I just tell people how much I love their food, and I'd like to try little bits of everything, but I prefer all my food to be served very hot.  This precludes salads but often includes the other veg and fruit, just cooked.  It also allows me an opportunity to offer to pay for extra cooking fuel, which means I can slip extra money to someone who might benefit from it.  \n\nIn this way I can eat in all.sorts of situations, have never had an illness issue, sometimes eat improvised tapas style, and often make friends.",
      "whenever I have gotten food poisoning, it's been from eating salad.",
      "How exactly is your eating more going to help anyone in the country? Anyway, most restaurants in poor countries have a system to give leftovers to  those in need. It\u2019s only in the US that people think it\u2019s a good idea to pass laws to force restaurants to throw away excess food",
      "Why not just say you don't want salad or any raw vegetables? Then if they bring it anyway, that's on them. I don't think it's fussy to want to avoid food poisoning. It's really not fun.",
      "I lived in a poor country and would often get way too much food. I'd ask them to package it up to go, then would end up giving it to a homeless person on the way home. Or to my doorman. They were always so grateful, maybe you could do that?",
      "I usually wrap up food I don't/can't eat and give it to either a homeless person or a street dog.",
      "I eat smaller portions too, and this kind of guilt trip is a huge pet peeve of mine. Having too much food on a plate that you didn't specifically order is NOT the eater's fault.\n\nParents who guilt/force their kids into over eating are being abusive. Basically it's \"I fucked up by making too much food but I'll blame it on you.\" Also, fuck any cultural tenet that says it's rude to leave food on your plate. That's bullying.\n\nYou tried to request less food, so you shouldn't feel guilty. No one should ever be guilted into eating more than they can.",
      "Asking for a half portion/small/child size is always an option, ask what is served with a dish and decline as needed. You can blame it on health restrictions if you feel you need an excuse. If you're frequenting/returning to a restaurant be honest and complimentary, tell them they gave you so much wonderful food last time you couldn't eat it all and would like a smaller portion.  No need to overthink it.",

Nothing got rid of them until I got food poisoning months later back in the states.\n\nWho cares if someone gives you a bad look.  Your health is FAR more important.",
      "I cannot solve poverty or hunger in the world with eating all the food on my plate. But id like to prevent being fat or obese or worse getting sick from eating food possibly contaminated with pathogens if i can help it.",

In the US if you have leftover lunch etc then you toss it.. but our safari guide was always diligent about taking any lunch leftovers from our group  and finding a home for it.. lots of willing and VERY happy people, people cleaning park restrooms, etc.  So we got in the habit of doing it even when he wasn't there and were always met with immense gratitude. \n\nUnlike in the US where people only want cash (cynically, to turn into alcohol or smokes or drugs), there's a lot of genuinely hungry people in eastern Africa who  really did appreciate our leftovers, including uncooked vegetables (which we also never ate!) . We were more than happy to do so. Even found ourselves eating less of our packed lunches etc. so we had more to give.",

The strange thing is that they often turn it away :(",

      "As far as eating vegetables goes, I think it depends on how you are, but there's nothing wrong with caution. \n\nIn Kenya and Uganda I stayed in some fairly pricy resorts and everyone (locals, guide, etc.) said it was all safe. And no one in my group had food poisoning issues. \n\nBut if I were at a local restaurant, yeah, I'd be cautious too. We didn't really do that. I didn't use tapwater for anything but washing my hands outside the resorts either.",
      "The same water that you're worried about was used to prepare all the other dishes you're comfortable eating. If that didn't give you food poisoning, salads or water shouldn't either. I may be wrong. \n\nAs for the large portions, in India, it's very common to request the server to pack the leftovers so you can take it home. Do this if you can, and give the parcel away to someone in need I'm the vicinity. That you don't have to feel guilty + someone in need gets some good food.",
      "I sympathize with you 100%. I have experienced this, but I\u2019m not from Africa. \n\nLiving with food insecurity scars you for a long time, if not forever. You are not reading too much into people\u2019s faces; sometimes, you can\u2019t hide it. After over a decade of having a better life, I still struggle with food waste with others and on a personal end.\n\nAsk them to give you only half of the portion and no raw food, and tell them you don\u2019t want to waste it. I did this recently at a hotel, and they understood. I would use Google Translate for this.\n\nThank you for caring.",
      "I usually eat anything when I feel the hygiene is okay. I only got food poisining once, and it was entierly my own fault (a stupid craving in Guatemala). \nBut hey, if you already now you won\u2018t eat raw veggies - which is fine - let them know BEFORE they serve the food.",

As for food waste, our guide was more than happy to pack up what we didn\u2019t want to eat and give it to the national reserve workers, park rangers, janitors, etc. everyone was very appreciative of that! Nothing\u2019s worse than having to be latched to a toilet or constantly near a restroom on your adventures!",
      "You don't need to feel guilty about it. People die of starvation mostly because of access of food and not mostly because they can't afford it.   \nI don't know about other countries but this is the fact in case of India.",
      "I typically get the leftovers to go, and if I know that I won\u2019t eat it later, I will give the box to a homeless individual so it doesn\u2019t go to waste. I haven\u2019t had an issue finding someone who would take the food in busy areas",
      "Whenever I fly for like 2-3 days after I can't eat a full sit-down meal. This works great for me in Europe where portion sizes are smaller, the food is lighter, and I can even stick to mostly snack food (meat and cheese, fruits, and baked goods) the first day when it's really bad\n\nBut I've also been to Africa, South America, and even Las Vegas where I not only felt bad for not finishing my food, but the people serving me seemed to be disappointed, or even making a point to ask me if there was anything wrong with my food, as a result of me not eating it.  \n\nI always just try to make a point to say it was delicious, and thank them for serving me. No need to excuse it. \n\nAfrica was one of the worst for me.  I was in Tanzania and we were doing a safari for part of the time and Kili for the other, and the hotel we were at tried so-so-so hard to make \"americanized\" dishes for us (we didn't ask, they really wanted to do it).  But unfortunately the ingredients quality just isn't there.  The \"steak\" was like a shoe for example.  The only time I was able to fill up was breakfast where I just ate a lot of fruit and carbs and plantain chips with hot sauce to snack on throughout the day. I felt so bad, they worked really hard on the food, but I just wished they would have made some more regional dishes instead of trying to make it \"American\" for us.  \n\nOtherwise though, aside from that, Africa was amazing",
      "I faced the same issue while I was visiting West Virginia and a few towns in Mississippi and Alabama.\n\nIt's ok to not finish all our food. You are in a hotel and not in somebody's home. You won't be the first nor the last person they encounter that doesn't clean their plate.",
      "If you are just passing by its not worth the trouble but if you have a few months eat and drink their food and water your stomach will harden this way.",
      "If you tip your server well, they will not care.\n\nIf they are making an irritated face, they likely are assuming you are unhappy with the food, and therefore are unhappy with them.",
      "Not Africa, but I live in a third world country. I'll try to break it to you gently, because you're obviously a gentle person. That underpaid and probably underfed server thinks you're just another spoiled rich tourist from a first world country, too lazy to learn the local language and too picky to eat their food. You probably already guessed as much. What you haven't guessed is that their opinion won't chance if you eat all that is in your plate. They will still be underpaid, you will still be the rich spoiled tourist. Sorry, but that's just how It is. Also, maybe in Africa the servers are not expected to be so friendly. In some contries the server is just a person who brings food and takes away your plate later. Tips might change it, but I very much doubt so",
      "Separate the raw food before you start your meal, tell the wait staff to take it back. That way, if they want to share it with someone, maybe they can. \n\nTouched food on the same platter may need to be thrown due to contamination",
      "I am a small traveler with frequent tummy issues- even normally. I do my best to order appropriately and then don\u2019t worry about it. Overeating, food poisoning, or  just the wrong food for my system will make travel miserable. Not worth it",
      "Maybe print a photo of a salad with a big red \"X\" over it and show it to staff at the restaurants? I think that would be easy to understand despite the language barriers. It's definitely better to communicate that you don't want the food instead of letting people serve it to you when you know you can't eat it.",
      "Can you just use google translate to tell them not to serve you the salad and to give you smaller portions? Or just a combination of miming and picking up the salad bowl to return it as soon as they serve the food?",
      "Rather dish up smaller portions and should you still be hungry then go for 2nds. People often get offended if you dont finish the food they have prepared for you.",
      "I\u2019ve been deployed all over Africa. If you grew up in the area, you\u2019re probably fine, but if you grew up in the States, do not eat the vegetables! Just trust me on this, I worked on the continent on and off for over five years and I\u2019ve had all sorts of nasty food poisonings. Also, don\u2019t get fish in the Sahel. You probably didn\u2019t need to be told that as it seems like common knowledge, but in my defense, it smelled really good. \n\nAs for not finishing your food, I wouldn\u2019t really sweat it. Odds are that the local perceptions of you are all in your head. Even if they aren\u2019t, I doubt that gorging yourself past the point at which you\u2019re full will endear them to you any more than not cleaning your plate. \n\nUltimately, you\u2019re on vacation. Worry less about what people think and just enjoy yourself. Africa is a vast and wonderful place that most westerners will never visit. Make the most of it!",
      "Sounds like 1) it\u2019s not really your choice since you booked through a travel company package deal, and 2) there\u2019s a safety issue, which I agree with. \n\nI\u2019ve traveled through East and South Asia, but never Africa. If I\u2019m ever anywhere remotely sketchy I only eat cooked food.  For example In India I won\u2019t eat salads outside of hotels that cater to European or US business travelers. My goal is to not have my trip ruined by a bad meal. If you only have limited days in a place you may never be able to come back to, I\u2019d rather play it safe.",
      "If you are bothered by this, you could pretend to pack the food in some tiffin box and dispose of it later. If this is at all possible.",
      "Ask them what is being served before they bring the food out, and tell them you are not very hungry and to not bring out the food you don't plan to eat. And if it's not possible to know beforehand what is being served, you can still deny the food when it is brought out. That way, you haven't touched the food and they can probably serve to someone else.",
      "I travelled in Kenya and had the same problem. They were preparing too much food for me at many of the places I was staying. I think it was maybe their way of trying to be good hosts but if I actually had to completely finish the plates I would have been so stuffed to the point of misery. \n\nDon\u2019t torture yourself because some people are suffering from food insecurity. You are not the cause of food shortages in the world. Do your best to not be wasteful and be respectful and thank them and that\u2019s about all you can and should do.",
      "Just ask to get the rest of the food wrapped up to go?",
      "> My travel companion feels that I am being overly cautious by not eating the salads (they have been to dozens of developing countries and eat raw vegetables without issues)\n\nDefinitely not too cautious. If you can't drink the tap water, you should avoid any raw fruits or vegetables unless you know for sure that the water has been filtered. The same goes for ice, which I wouldn't have thought of if a tour guide in India hadn't pointed it out. \n\n> I should just clear more of my plate regardless of how full I am.\n\nThis is a weird one, because on one hand aren't you playing into the glutonous Western stereotype by eating too much? And really, whether or not you clear your plate won't help any poor people in that country. I kind of get it that it could create a weird appearance though, particularly as some cultures may take offense to their food not being eaten. Having said that, if the place regularly serves Westerners, you're surely not going to be the first person who avoided the raw vegetables.",
      "I was once hospitalized for food poisoning in a rich European country. Food poisoning is dangerous and it took my digestive system about 3 years to fully heal. Sometimes caution is the best course of action. I'll add that after I got out of the hospital in this rich country, I went to a news stand to buy a few bottles of water because my stomach was obviously still upset. The vendor gave me an incredulous look as if to say, \"our tap water is safe.\" Whatever. People can think what they want when you look out for your health. Your health is more important than any judgement.",
      "I lived in Mauritania in West Africa. Missed salads and raw vegetables. Went to a popular restaurant with many in the diplomatic community. Salads were served. I thought surely this was a safe place to eat a salad. Wrong. Food poisoning is not fun. I live in SE Asia now and rarely get sick. I credit those salads with bolstering my immune system. Also, I can never finish the massive amount of rice that is served with each meal of the day. Sometimes I will barely touch it. You just have to be ok with being different.",
      "Soooo this was in Zimbabwe where I went for a boma dinner.. a heavy food for just the foreigners. After the end, i saw lot of meat still left.. I asked the waiter what will become of this, do u take it to your home everyday? He said \" No this will be thrown to hyenas\" if we take this food we are fired.. then i understood how wrong the tourist boma dinner was.",
      "I try to carry a doggy bag with me or ask the restaurant for an empty take away box. I take out as much food as I plan on eating and set the rest aside. I either offer the restaurant to give it to a needy person if one comes in, or give it to someone once I step out of the place. In most these countries (I'm from one of them), there is always someone in need of food..",
      "There is questionable evidence that drinking hard alcohol with a meal reduces the likelihood of food poisoning. Do what you please with this knowledge.",
      "When I'm unable to finish the food, but still think that it was tasty - I always tell it the waiter and they are happy that I liked the food :)",
      "Usually rules of food I follow during travel. Unless you having it in a high end resturant. Avoid all cold food. If it's hot you have a better chance. Avoid the jug water. Ice is usually the culprit avoid ice. \n\nIn regard to food. Of you wasting a lot bag it and around the street corner you will find people who haven't eaten just hand it Iverson to them.",
      "Doesn't seem like a big deal. If you don't want to eat it, don't. If they seem grumpy it could be for a number of other things, yeah maybe it's because you left some of the food, but that's one of over a dozen things it could be so don't worry about it. If it really bothers you, start getting takeaway, eat what you can and dispose of the rest in a way where the kitchen staff will never know what you didn't eat."

      "\u0130stanbul is not a bad place despite what majority seem to be suggesting but you need to do your research prior and be smart. Sultanahmet is a known tourist trap followed only by Beyo\u011flu, particularly the Istiklal part as these are the most touristic places but this is not any different from any other major tourist destination. I was in Venice this spring and the prices for any cafe or restaurant within the centre were also much higher than even just a few streets away, sometimes the food was also not as good. You could easily avoid problems relating to tourist traps by staying in a different district/neighbourhood, \u0130stanbul has very good and well-connected public transportation esp when it comes to metro, so it will not affect your abilities to get around at all\u2026especially considering the fact that most of the historic sights are actually quite close to each other.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, get out of the city centre for a day and visit other places such as Balat on the European side or Kuzguncuk in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar or Moda in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y on the Asia side to give yourself a breather. The ferry ride across the Bosphorus by itself may already put you in a different mood :) \n\nAs for the high prices, Turkey is in an economic crisis since 2021 combined with lira devaluation and hyperinflation. Last year\u2019s inflation was 130%, it\u2019s understandable that this will rise prices for everything unfortunately. Tourist sights such as museums as well as regular establishments like restaurants etc also need to raise their prices in general as the costs of maintaining these locations as well as rent and bills are constantly increasing...for example, even the rent for my apartment which used to be 10 000TL in 2019 is now 35 000 TL.",
      "I'm sorry this happened to you. A few tips I realized:\n\nSultanamet is full of crooks. Keep your items safe. Agree on prices and stay firm at the start of a taxi ride because they will rip you off. \n\nFood is terrible in Istanbul, UNLESS you eat where the locals eat. Look up Istanbul food recs on reddit and you'll be so much happier. \n\nThe Asian side is still touristy in some areas but much calmer and more enjoyable. \n\nVisit the mosques in Sultanamet and don't linger. I agree entry fees are very high.",
      "I got ripped off by a taxi driver in Istanbul out of a few lira anyway,  a classic tourist trap move. Lesson learned: public transportation is faster and cheaper. I traveled light, just a tiny wallet with a credit card and a few lira for emergencies, and my trusty phone.  \n\nAs for food, there are plenty of budget-friendly spots. Just avoid the tourist traps in Sultanahmet, where they\u2019ll charge you a king\u2019s ransom for a mediocre kebab.\nI had an amazing two weeks exploring the Princes\u2019 Islands and Kadikoy. I ate like royalty for next to nothing. Some of the best meals of my life, seriously!"

      "When I was living in Amsterdam my friends and I did a Trappist beer tour weekend road trip- let\u2019s just say it was the sort of weekend where you did *not* show up at the office better rested than when you left, but was a great experience! Of those, I remember Westvleteten being the best experience (because they only make enough to cover monastery costs so they have beers only available there), and La Trappe was second best- just as cool a vibe but you can get most of the stuff they had in Amsterdam too. \n\nWorst btw was Chimay. Never been a huge fan of the beers but then their brewery is actually far from the monastery so it felt like a more generic tourist bar, you can get all those beers around the world anyway so felt like a long way to go for nothing special, *and* we were super hungry but they forgot our food for over an hour."

      "The variety and specialization tends to be better in the actual places. Foreign versions of foods tend to become standardized caricatures, to the point that \"Italian\" or \"Chinese\" in the US is generally not actually Italian or Chinese, and I expect that is similar in Poland. People adapt to local preferences and locally available ingredients.\n\nGood French bread is made from good French wheat flour. Flour is mostly sold as a commodity, but there are differences between producers. Same for growing tomatoes in Italy. You can get canned San Marzano tomatoes outside Italy, but if you want to cook with fresh ones, they're only there.\n\nIt's easy to say that it's just pretentiousness, but I've eaten bread in a lot of countries, and it's genuinely not good in some even though they're using basically the same processes.",
      "I've had some of the worst Mexican food in Albania and Poland. Chinese food is poorly replicated in most of the world. Thai is rarely up to snuff outside of SE Asia. Italian food is often poorly replicated as well. I've had some fair versions of Indonesia in a couple of countries, but it isn't something I've commonly seen anyway. Some of the Hungarian dishes I've had in the US are definitely not as good as what I had in Hungary and Romania.\n\nI haven't been to India yet, but the Indian food I had in Malaysia and Sri Lanka suggests to me that Indian is also poorly replicated in much of the world.\n\nEDIT: The Indian food I had in Malaysia and Sri Lanka was amazing. Poorly replicated elsewhere.",

Same with any other cuisine. This is accentued with seafood dishes, because many fresh seafood dishes can't even be exported in many places.\n\nThen obviously, if by tasting a cuisine you're ok with trying the two/three most famous dishes of a country, you can be content with eating that cuisine in your home city.",
      "This is an -awful- take. It\u2019s almost never the same. I live in one of the best cities in the world for this, it is almost never the same. \n\nThis is probably due to availability of ingredients, cookware, cooking methods, labor force, and proprietors adjusting their menus to local taste, and in sure plenty of other factors I don\u2019t know about.\n\nOn top of that, even if they do the dishes they do the same quality (koreatown in LA), the breadth of dishes is not the same. Plenty of Korean food you won\u2019t find in Korea town.\n\nForgot one: local regulations. At least in SF, it is not legal to serve al pastor tacos straight off the trompo; not sure in LA. This makes the tacos suck.",

You can get almost anything, but that version might not be great.\n\nAs far as food tourism, I did a week in the Peruvian amazon and the food was incredible. I love eating and consider myself adventurous but almost every ingredient I had was new to me, cooking methods were new to me. I had fish cooked in the hollow of a bamboo stalk that they lean over the fire, with roasted ear mushrooms (not wood ears) that we collected on our walk earlier. I mean, there\u2019s just this rich diversity in ingredients there that can only be collected, not cultivated and shipped elsewhere.",
      ">I visited a lot of them, compared them to the same food in their countries of origin and well... it's the same (or almost the same).\n\nI think we live in different universes.\n\nThere's maybe a handful of pizzerie in every big European country that reach the level of the average pizzeria in Naples or Caserta. And that's for pizza, one of the most iconic, popular, and easily available dishes in the world. For slightly less well-known dishes, forget about foreign countries, you have to go to the right region, sometimes the right part of the right region. For the really local dishes, you have to go that one town. Even for dishes that are not obscure, you want different kinds of dishes you could find in one Italian city (say, the street food, the pasta or rice dishes, the seafood and the sweets)? You'll be going all over Europe to find them all; you might as well just go to that city. This is for Italian cuisine, which is popular worldwide. For other cuisines it's as bad or worse.\n\nThere's a handful of genuine Georgian restaurants in big European countries - not the good ones in a sea of mediocre ones like for pizzerie, but any restaurant owned or managed by Georgians and making Georgian food (not \"Slavic cuisine\" with a couple of Georgian dishes thrown in). Authentic Mexican is nigh-impossible to find, with very few exceptions and very limited selections. Good East African can be found, but it's highly localized. South Indian food is a struggle; I think I've found two places making decent dosa in several European countries I've lived in. And so on and so forth.\n\nDon't get me wrong, a big city with lots of immigrants has lots of interesting food options form around the world. I'm not complaining about the food scene in London or even Berlin or Rotterdam. But if you consider cuisine from one tradition, the breadth and quality can't compare with going to the place of origin.",
      "You are not telling me that pizza is as good as in Napoli, right? \n\nAnyways, you are wrong. It still makes sense to travel and eat local food, because it is going to be, if not better, at least different. Eating Japanese in Warsaw is never going to be like in Tokyo.",
      "I used to live in Los Angeles, which is known for having great Mexican food, but the variety you can get in Mexico is much different. There are regional cuisines as well, like Yucat\u00e1n food.\n\nI\u2019ve been to Poland 3 times and if you think you can get the same things you can get traveling you\u2019re just wrong. This is like a mom telling her kid they have McDonald\u2019s at home then giving the kid kotlety.",
      "Depends on the cuisine and location. In Europe I tend to not visit Chinese or Japanese restaurants as it\u2019s harder to find the authentic stuff there.\n\nI\u2019ve tasted amazingly authentic Italian food in and outside of Italy, and across multiple continents.\n\nI struggle to find really good Vietnamese food outside Vietnam, but once in a while you find an absolute banger of a place (usually some hole-in-the-wall joint).\n\nI\u2019ve had great burgers, bread, and pastries (French or otherwise) all over the world.\n\nLondon has some pretty good Indian restaurants (and overall I think it\u2019s got a great culinary scene with many different cuisines, and authentic versions of them at that).",

Of course don't \"just\" do food tourism (going to Naples just for the pizza and sfogliatelle sounds like a waste tbh).\n\nAlso a lot of \"foreign foods\" are customized to your palate, e.g. I highly doubt you will have super authentic Thai almost anywhere in Europe (maybe London as an exception)",

      "I\u2019m sorry but are you saying the ramen in Warsaw is as good as the ramen in Japan? If thats your opinion, thats ok but if you can\u2019t tell the difference you probably shouldn\u2019t travel for food.",

      "While Warsaw has good Vietnamese food, there's a whole segment of Viet cuisine that cannot be exported, namely anything seafood related. Vietnamese seafood is incredible but it's best fresh. This also applies to fruits. Rambutan or lychee can stand transport fairly well, but dragon fruit is just sad.",
      "It's a fair argument, food and ingredients are mostly global. I grew up without trying any Asian food for most of my early life and now Asian food is ubiquitous.\n\nHowever, most global food is designed for 1) transport survivability and 2) ROI. \n\nIngredients which don't travel without spoiling quickly don't get distributed.\n\nFoods which require a higher cost of labor also don't get distributed.\n\nWhat that means is you will experience flavor profiles from local ingredients that can't be easily replicated on a global scale.  \n  \nYou can have a mole in a small pueblo in southern Mexico or hotate sushi in Hokkaido that's going to be a different experience than you can get in the bigger cities.\n\nSource: wildlife photographer, traveler and modernist cuisine chef.",
      "As someone who spent a lot of time in Warsaw before there were foreign restaurants, can I just say what an awesome and amazing food culture has sprung up there?   I was in awe last time I visited.  I am so old I remember the opening of the first Taco Bell, and they had to explain what burritos were (\"nale\u015bniki meksyka\u0144skie,\" which seems to miss the point a little bit...)",
      "Your last sentence answers your question. Yes, you can replicate the food from wherever but it won't and will not be the same as the local food as it is.\n\nIf I go to a restaurant that's supposedly offers authentic food from my country of origin, and then gets to be served, no, it is not what you call it is supposed to be. I'll eat it, but my cravings are not satisfied because I know how it tastes, how it feels, how it smells, how it's supposed to look like. The minute details preparing these food back to where they are originally prepared adds to the experience. Ilocano papaitan is not and will not be \"papaitan\" unless it is done in the Ilocos Region of the Philippines; same as the Bicol Express if not prepared in the Bicol Region. These two dishes are not easily replicated even around the Philippines itself. Only the locals know how to prepare these, and it is passed down from generation to generation and the real ingredients are not readily available anywhere else.\n\nSausages themselves are never what they are supposed to be comparing from the original to what is prepared in your new environment.",
      "I travel a fair amount and eat a lot. While I see what you\u2019re saying, I\u2019m absolutely not looking for Mexican food in Poland. Any large and open city will hopefully have a good deal of immigrants who are bringing their food - it\u2019s why there\u2019s tons of good Chinese food in Vancouver, Indian food in London, Thai in Tokyo, northern African food in Spain, etc. I find that the more closed off a country is (looking at you Italy) the less interesting the food. A place touting good pizza in Japan or Mexican in the UK I\u2019m approaching with major side eye and extreme caution. \n\nGreat food comes from passion, education/history/training and access to appropriate ingredients, all are often in short supply (especially the first). You also need to know the limits of where you\u2019re traveling - for example I used to go to nyc a lot and had to accept the fact that the city, our biggest and one of the most diverse and food-centric, is NOT a coffee town. \n\nI\u2019m in California fwiw. To answer your question, food is my favorite part of traveling. Whether that\u2019s food tourism is up for debate. It\u2019s also always a blast going to local grocery stores, best way to immediately immerse yourself.",
      "Yes, if food is more than a meal to you. For me, it's an experience and an opportunity to bond with people, and the who, when, where, and why are all just as important as the what.",
      "I really enjoyed the Polish food in Poland, even though I had had some terrific Polish food in New York, where I\u2019m from. Some of my best food memories are from my one trip to Poland, for a conference in Krakow about a decade ago. \n\nSorry if that\u2019s not a very helpful answer ;) but I do hope to get back to Poland again one day. One of my favorite kinds of food and quite difficult to find outside Poland!",
      "Chinese food. \n\nI\u2019m not talking dumplings or buns, but specific dishes, when replicated outside of China is different. There are some labour intensive dishes that aren\u2019t done well. Example- roast pork. They roast an entire pig in most shops and you can just buy the cut you want. They can do this due to the density of the population.",
      "Context matters a great deal in any dining experience. Our brains are very susceptible to suggestion and subtle changes in environment or mood can completely change our perception of flavour. Before you account for all the subtle differences that come from water, soil, animal welfare, climate, economy etc, sights, sounds,  smells and feelings play a huge role as well. \n\nAnd I also disagree with your premise that bevause it's all the same recipe it's the same food. Sure one could argue that it's all just molecules and chemical processes and if you cook the exact same ingredients the same way you get the same food, but that's just not really how it plays out.  McDonald's has built a multi billion dollar business on tasting the same everywhere and even big macs still  have regional differences despite the company's best efforts to standardise it. Even within high end restaurants consistency of flavour and texture is a constant battle.\n\nEating Malaysian food on a cold winter night, inside in Europe somewhere is enjoyable, but it's fundamentally a different culinary experience eating Malaysian food in an open sided hut on a beach with warm sea air carrying the smell of tropical flowers, durian and diesel fumes.",
      "I\u2019m Japanese-American, I grew up and also lived and worked in Japan for many years. I\u2019d say that the sushi outside of Japan is really not that good, except for very expensive places that have chefs that really know what they\u2019re doing. Most general \u201csushi\u201d places serve makizushi rolls with sauces and fried things that are really gross. Even with the nigiri, many times there is too much wasabi or sauce and it overpowers the other flavors.\n\nQuality of fish and also using the correct rice is the biggest difference, but also even serving it at the right temperature is important. I notice this a lot. And just because the chef is Japanese, does not guarantee quality of sushi.\n\nBut maybe non-Japanese prefer that style, so it is fine. As long as people enjoy it, that is what matters.\n\nBut Japanese sushi is the best, and it\u2019s worth it to visit and see the difference.\n\nEdit: I\u2019d like to add one more example; French food. Specifically, things like Quennelles, Salad Lyonnaise, and some other tripe dishes I had. Fairly ordinary foods that are not too complicated.\nNothing compares to what I had in Lyon, and my wife and I tend to eat out and seek good food wherever we go. I\u2019d suspect that the ingredients and technique, plus range of dishes, is just not reasonable to replicate elsewhere, as most \u201cFrench\u201d restaurants outside of France tend to target high end dining.",
      "I love warsaw but Mexican food there Is NOT MEXICAN FOOD",
      "If you can't taste the difference between the local version of a food and the genuine version in the native location when you travel, that's up to you.",
      "Yep, agree with most of the comments. You\u2019re right that there are plenty of global restaurants but very, very few get it authentically right. As an example, Italian food is available all over the world. In the US it\u2019s everywhere. But tasting food in an Italian restaurant in the US is polar opposite to tasting it in Italy. Too much sauce, too little flavour. Recently had an absolutely scandalous Cacio e Pepe in a highly rated restaurant in Chicago. Clearly a chef who had no clue how to make Italian food. So yes, food tourism is 100% worth it.",
      "One thing I will say is that good ethnic food can be found ANYWHERE if you look hard enough. Had some really good Korean Kimchi in Colorado of all places.\u00a0\n\nBut in general, yes, I\u2019d say going to places for food is so worth it. Japanese ramen is just on another level, and even if you find one good local ramen spot, the quality of the average ramen shop in Japan is incredible.\u00a0\n\nJust remember, even the food quality standards are different country to country. Bread in France/Spain/Italy is far better than most bread in the US, and a lot of it has to do with both what ingredients are allowed and food standards for each country.",
      "This kind of makes it sound like you don't eat adventurously when you travel. Like you only order dishes that are also available in your home country, and eat at places that cater to tourists.\n\nI'm in Mexico City and the food here is completely different from the Mexican food I've had in the US. Even foods with the same name are different.",
      "Cuisines that I think are worth traveling for\n\nVietnam - Vietnamese food abroad is very dumbed down. In Vietnam it\u2019s much more varied and the southern region has a lot of tropical flavors that are hard to replicate. \n\nJapan - Sure you kind sushi anywhere, but Japan has tons of regional dishes that you won\u2019t find abroad. Plus the quality of the fish is very important for sushi, and that\u2019s something that is much lower outside of Japan.\n\nPeru - The popular dishes can be found everywhere, but again the regional dishes will be limited to Peru. Really hard to find suspiro a la lime\u00f1a, ceviche norte\u00f1o, juane, or sopa seca+carapulcra abroad.",
      "Food tourism is not just about eating in restaurants.

      "Well, I get what you\u2019re saying and I tend to leave the food of the place I\u2019m visiting as the main focus of cuisine that I\u2019m out to explore and enjoy. However, I always try to find a thai restaurant in every country or city that i visit. I have had some incredibly authentic thai dishes in Madrid, Ljubljana and Istanbul.\nOn another note of food tourism, I\u2019m taking a 15 day guided tour through Sri Lanka that focuses entirely on visiting different food regions, restaurants and taking part of cooking classes. I\u2019d be interested in seeing how it translates to further food tourism experiences.",
      "I live in a city with a pretty high quality diverse food scene, but I still enjoy travelling for food (among other stuff). There are a number of reasons why:\n\n* Most restaurants adjust their cooking for local tastes. Consequently, food in its country of origin is often different.\n* Atmosphere matters a lot. And other countries add a lot.\n* While my city has a diverse range of restaurants, it doesn't compare to the world.\n* Restaurants usually focus on the famous dishes. There are a lot more out there.",
      "That\u2019s not in the same realm as food tourism, not even close. Those are still going to be foods diluted/changed so it fits the local taste buds, certainly in restaurants need to turn a profit. \n\nThose aren\u2019t authentic to the country/city/neighborhood of origin, not unless there\u2019s a massive community of immigrants there. The point of food tourism is an authentic local experience",
      "One thing you'll have a hard time finding abroad (outside of their native countries) is the wide variety of street foods and vendors.",
      "I don\u2019t think so.\n\nWhen I think of the best global foods I\u2019ve ever had, they\u2019re all either from a visit to a local family\u2019s home (so home-cooked food) or something super random from some hole-in-the-wall (the ones that come to mind are a chicken meatball soup I had in Prague and a lemon chicken dish I had in Fez).\n\nSo they\u2019re either not something you can go there specifically seeking in restaurants or something you wouldn\u2019t necessarily be looking for.",
      "It depends. I very rarely find Pho that beats my favorite places in Da Nang, but maybe thats me being biased. However, you can find Italian food in Tokyo that is vastly superior to what I could find in Italy. The Japanese are Top Notch Chefs in damn near every cuisine.",

On the topic of globally influenced cuisine, like our curries, I\u2019d say that no other country in Europe has the diversity and quality of curries that we do, so unless you\u2019re going to India, I highly recommend visiting the UK for food tourism when it comes to South Asian influenced cuisine. \n\nMany other countries have local foods that I can\u2019t find elsewhere too.",
      "Just because you have a restaurant that can make a dish let\u2019s say like Pad Thai in your city let\u2019s say the place is Thai and the cook is Thai. The food will not be as good as what you can get in Thailand!",

But it hits a bit different when you are enjoying the food, the atmosphere, and the culture all at the same time. So don\u2019t just travel for the food, travel for the whole experience.",
      "For me, to travel for food isn't just about the actual food, the journey, setting, people and ambience all add a big part to it. I can eat pasta from a strip mall here in the US, but that experience would be vastly different vs eating it in a small alley way in the cobbled streets of Rome.",
      "The only country I've spent time in where the national cuisine can be made equally well outside the country, if not better than in the country of origin, is Indonesia.  I've had top notch Indonesian food that's better than what I've had in Indonesia itself in both California and the Netherlands.  However, I think the reason for this is that in Indonesia, the food is often made with poor quality ingredients.  I can say this for both home made and restaurant made meals.\n\nIt is interesting, because in much of the rest of Southeast Asia, the food cannot be replicated as well outside of the country.  Thai food is great in many places around the world, but there's nothing like having it in Thailand.  I would say this is even more particularly true for Malaysian and Singaporean straits cuisine.  Same with Vietnamese food.",
      "Food tourism is definitely much worth it. I was born and raised in Mexico, but currently live in the USA. Both countries are right next to each other, yet, Mexican food in the USA doesn't even compare to Mexican food in Mexico, even in places like California or Texas. There is something about the food in Mexico that just can't quite be replicated even by immigrants in the USA, probably the produce is more fresh among other factors. \n\nAlso, is not even just about the quality, it's about the diversity, there's looots of Mexican dishes that are not as well known because they are very unique to each state, or even a small region. So even if you find decent Mexican food in USA, you'll mainly just find the most common dishes (tacos, tamales, tortas, etc.) I have yet to see memelas or chinameca meat in the USA, or cacao pozol. Cochinita tacos are not even an option where I live in Idaho. Maybe California.\n\nI imagine this is 10x more true for things like Indian or Vietnamese cuisine in Germany, where those countries are not even close to each other.",

      "I think food tourism is still worth it. The food might taste the same to you, but it may not be so, especially if you travel outside of the touristy areas. The dishes people import when they open their own restaurants is aimed at residents who mostly can't always afford to travel themselves or have limited ability to travel. Plus, I find that a lot of dishes available in a specific country aren't always available at restaurants outside of said country. For example, the variety of Japanese food available in most countries consists of ramen, sushi, katsudon, and curry, and if you're lucky, maybe a dessert or pastry. Whereas in Japan, you might have far more dishes on a menu that you've never seen before at a Japanese restaurant in Poland.",
      "It probably depends on the food and your location. You can get pretty good pizza in any town of 1k people nearly anywhere in the world I bet, but if you like pierogi or paella, youre probably gunna need to travel to either a big city or the relevant country. I do say this as someone who's living in a city of 85k so obviously big cities will have a bigger selection.\n\nPersonally I probably wouldn't be going somewhere solely for the food, but it's still going to be a factor I consider",

      "The majority of restaurants in the US get their ingredients from a company called Sysco.

I think food tourism rocks but wouldn't limit my visit to trying food only.",

      "I also live in Warsaw, and although you can pretty much get most international cuisines, most of them are 'close, but not quite there.' This results in getting a taste of a particular cuisine, but it's really not like the original.  The most glaring example is Mexican food. All I can say that it's 'Mexican-inspired.' Same thing with Thai food. There's plenty of Thai restaurants & they are really quite good, but it's not the same as eating Thai food in the streets of Bangkok.",

      "Food is almost never ever as good outside its home.  Even if its good, even if the person is \"from there\", it wont be near the same",
      "Yes and no, while you can get any food anywhere nowadays, the real deal is still quite a bit better because of the local ingredients used, the local water, and the cooking techniques used. So yes I can get Mexican food in the UK but its probably not going to be S-tier.\n\nOne could choose many examples, but one that comes to mind is French bread and croissants... you can get these anywhere now but I have to say they all pale in comparison to the real ones in France. Especially in the USA where I live, our croissants are disgusting.\n\nSame thing with Pizza. While I do not subscribe to the idea that real deal authentic Italian pizza is the ONLY viable style of pizza (variety is the spice of life), the way they make it in Italy is hard to find anywhere else and very delicious.",

      "Taste/flavor is just one part of the multi sensory experience that is dining in a place that is foreign to you (and personally I think there are a lot of barriers to truly replicating taste/flavor).\n\nHere are two examples from my home in Texas:\n\nPizza \u2014 you cannot get pizza in TX that comes near NY pizza. A transplanted NY pizzeria owner explained to me that it\u2019s humidity levels impacting the crust making and baking, that can never be overcome despite the best oven etc. I have no idea if that\u2019s the actual reason but is sounds plausible because different versions of the disappointing non-NY like crusts are all over the state. \n\nMore specific to my multi sensory comment \u2014 \n\nTexas BBQ \u2014 being a local, I perceive tremendous variation in tenderness, cuts and quality, type of preparation, flavor aspects (sauce) etc, but also huge difference depending whether I\u2019m in the city or country, in a dining room with freezing AC and college football on tv or outside at a picnic table enjoying live music eating off a floppy paper plate, at a place that\u2019s been in a family for generations with their own cooking secrets and drama and love going into the endeavor, or a new place with trained chefs applying their new ideas and people lined up around the block to be there before the ribs run out. That\u2019s only restaurants \u2014 before you get to family traditions, hanging out with the grill master, folks debating methods around the grill, eating it all tired from tubing in a cold river all day on a scorching hot day, finishing it off with watermelon stickiness all over your arms.\n\nTo me it\u2019s about the whole ecology and culture that a food developed in, and immersion in that multi sensory experience.",

      "Hot take: I 100% agree with you. I think people should definitely try as much of the local food in the country they\u2019re visiting (you\u2019d be surprised how many people I know go to Asia and want to eat pizza and pasta) but travelling JUST for the food is quite odd for me and a waste of money in my opinion since you can get dishes quite close in almost any major city. For example, part of the reason I wanted to travel to Thailand was for the food but I found the Thai food in Toronto (where I\u2019m from) to be at or better in quality and flavour than most Thai restaurants in ate in Thailand.",
      "I live in the US so I feel like it's a bit different (so much of our grocery/produce is growth hormoned or sugared into submission) but I've found Indian, Japanese, Thai, Mexican that is *tasty* but it is not the same as those actual regions. And I've only really liked Mexican food in San Diego or Mexico/central America. I haven't had much Latin food outside of that. Everywhere else is garbage, imo. \n\nI thought I LOVED Vietnamese food (I'd only really had pho and bahn mi), and I think I really like americanized Vietnamese food. I tried a bunch, liked a bunch, but it wasn't what I was expecting. The textures of the processed meats specifically was surprising. \n\nI genuinely haven't found food as good as Napoli, I've found things that are close and still good, but not the same. \n\nSushi in Japan is of much higher quality imo, and the flavors are more pronounced and unique in the Udon, or omelets, or karage, than in the US. Though I think really good Ramen and izakaya style food is much easier to find in the US, especially on the west coast.",
      "Thai food, Vietnamese food, Colombian food (especially the fruit), Peruvian food (the ceviche)... Turkish food (their tea and coffee and breakfast spreads). I mean I could go on and on. Food is a very valid motivation for travel.",
      "I\u2019d like to say no, but that was before I went to Vietnam. The food scene there is really something else. Vietnamese food in Vietnam is on a whole new level and it\u2019s really quite affordable too. So, yes, 100% food tourism in Vietnam.",
      "Mexican food outside of North America is always a total disappointment.",
      "Bad take, even the states adjacent to Texas can\u2019t replicate Texas BBQ.  Mexican food in Mexico is on another level, especially in Mexico City.  Some southern spots in California get close, but that\u2019s it, just \u201cclose\u201d.",

But there\u2019s still more niche foods that don\u2019t make their way out of Japan, for instance. I have a hard time finding good nabe or good Hakata style ramen. \n\nPlus, a lot of it is about the surroundings. It\u2019s fun to eat food in Japan.",
      "Reading this thread you really start to understand how travel is all about consumption - with the immense amount of pollution and greenhouse gases stemming from travel it seems like food tourism is one of the worst in this regard and really emphasizes how many travelers are really just in it to consume more and more. Like the joke about how wine collecting is a hobby not an addiction when at its heart it\u2019s about consumption - just like food tourism gives a veneer of respectability to gluttony. In general it seems much more ethical to travel in place like you suggest. The worst of the worst seems to be the travelers who just try to check off as many places as possible - you can\u2019t really claim to be environmentally conscious and have that type of lifestyle.",
      "Are you a smoker? Maybe your taste buds just can't discern the difference... Or maybe you didn't find authentic restaurants in your travels.\n\nThere is absolutely no comparison to the *real deal* version of Italian, French, Mexican, Chinese, Egyptian, Turkish, Indian, etc foods. Not to mention all the amazing fruit and seafood only available locally. Did you know there's several types of papayas? Red papaya in Hawaii is something I'll never forget! Ohh and the food in the South of India... Omg. Ingredients in those vegetarian curries etc are actually different from what you see in the West (ground nuts and lentils often blended inside).",

So traveling for food in Italy is not worth it because I can make spaghetti at home? \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe best of the specific cuisine in your town can hardly beat the best in the home country. Everyone can make Ramen, but can they beat Japan? Haha \n\nAlso, these restaurants tend to be too general. So while they can sell the dishes, not everything is going to be good. And there are many dishes you can only find in their home country.\n\nI had Ramen in Medellin, Colombia. Yeah, it\u2019s ramen. Noodle, broth, and Charsiu. But the broth was sour \ud83d\ude05 and apparently it was the best in the city.",
      "Some foods, yes. Like Mexican and Italian. Part of it for people in the US is the ambiance of it too. There are certain things you just can\u2019t get or it\u2019s difficult to.\u00a0",
      "One of our favorite trips was to Cartagena Colombia where we did a foodie tour. We learned so much on the trip and had some amazing food. I've had most of the same things elsewhere, e.g., patacones, but the ones we tried were simply amazing. So while we may not go to Tokyo just for the sushi, we'll definitely try some when there.",

      "For me, it's all about the ingredients. \n\nLet's take wine because everyone seems to understand it. Some places are better for growing grapes than others. And thus they make better wine.\n\nIt's the same with everything else. There are places which grow great tomatoes, garlic, onions, avocados, passion fruit and similar. It happens to be called \"Hawaii.\" ;-)\n\nI'll travel to a new country just to try a crab or some salmon. And as many places as I've been, I've never been anywhere where the food was awful.",
      "For me personally every trip was eye opening. It's a huge difference to experience the local cuisine in its homeland and culture. From Thailand to Italy and everything in between the food was absolutely unique and awesome. And don't get me wrong, I love my local Asian restaurants und Pizzerias but there is just nothing that beats eating a perfect pizza in the old town of an Italian city. Or eating mango sticky rice in a Bangkok night market, ... You get the idea.",
      "You are not wrong in some of your points, but food tourism is definitely worth it... TO THE RIGHT TYPE OF FOODIE AND RIGHT TYPE OF TRAVELER with the right mindset of rules of eating when traveling.\n\nI like to eat local dishes that have local ingredients and dishes that are not easily replicated back in my home country.  For instance, a tripe stew in Guatemala, Caribbean seafood soup in Cartagena, proper boat noodles in Boat noodle alley in Thailand, \n\nAlso many cuisines have cooking vessels that other restaurants in other countries probably don't use for local regulation reasons.  For instance, most people have not eaten Thai stir fry cooked over a flaming hot tao charcoal grill.  There's a good chance people in Europe haven't had Mexican food cooked over a mesquite grill or underground pit in an European restaurant.  \n\nFreshness of ingredients can never be replicated in a global market (yet at least).  For instance, the fresh seafood of local fish and shellfish in Lima cannot be replicated in Poland.  Also there is sometimes a difference in taste in the local version of an ingredient vs your home country ingredient.  Example...pork.  Pork in the US tastes like bland cardboard because it is so lean (because of the 1980's fat phobia craze) versus pork in Latin American where the pigs are fatter and tastier.\n\nAlso many dishes get butchered by locals who either tweak dishes to fit locals tastes or they don't have access to the proper ingredients.  The example that comes to mind is Thai food.  I can guarantee you that the vast majority of people who have not gone to Thailand have not eaten Thai food that locals eat.  Most versions are overly sweetened for the Western palette. They'll substitute local veggies (broccolli vs Gailan/yu choy) etc.\n\nYou aren't wrong in that there are some cuisines and types of foods that are easier to replicate around the global and due to their popularity amongst tourists and locals and those foods would be: Pizza, burgers, pasta, \"Mexican\" food,  \"Japanese\" food, and now \"Thai\" places are common. \n\nI have A LOT of home bias.  I live in Southern California and we have the best Mexican, Thai, Korean, Vietnamese food and maybe Chinese and Japanese food outside of their respective countries.  \n\nThis means I'm not interested in traveling to Brazil to eat Thai food or traveling to Portugal  to eat Mexican food because I don't want some sloppy interpretation when there are way better, more interesting options to eat.  I've got the best versions outside their respective countries back at home.  This perspective will be way different from someone from another country, heck even another state in the US.\n\nAt the end of the day, entrepreneurs are going to always find a way to supply local markets with different cuisines especially that today's society is even more globalized and more well traveled than generations past and more open to eating different foods.  But due to sourcing ingredients, freshness of ingredients, and cooking vessel limitations some countries and not going to be able to replicate dishes easily."

Some types of cuisine are worse due to less availability of ingredients or worse technique (Italian food) but in general you can get the same quality in the US in most cities.

I'm leaving stuff like portion sizes and other cultural stuff out.\n\n\\- Food at restaurants is generally good, but often very salty.\n\n\\- Produce tastes \"watered down\". Tomatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, and especially fruit seem to only have 50% of the taste in them. I suppose it's because of being genetically modified to have a longer shelf life. I don't consider that unhealthy or anything, it's just not as satisfying. Fresh fruit is really expensive in Japan so I always buy a lot to snack on when I visit the states, but it's never satisfying.\n\n\\- Chocolate is mostly disgusting, it smells like and faintly tastes like vomit. I've heard it's due to a preservative used in the US. I NEVER noticed this growing up, but after being away for a few years and opening a bag of Hershey's kisses I immediately noticed.\n\n\\- Meat quality is different than what I'm used to in Japan, but I think it's more cultural. Americans tend to like really lean meat, which is considered tough and gross to much of the world. It seems rubbery and tasteless to me now. I totally get where your Polish friends were coming from, if I didn't know better I might think it's fake.\n\n\\- Eggs are so weird, they're like bright light yellow. I haven't noticed a difference in taste though.\n\n\\- Sweets are SO sweet, like super fucking sweet. Soda also seems sweeter. I think it's the HFCS content maybe?\n\n\\- (Edit) Another comment reminded me, milk products taste much \"milkier\" here. I'm actually lactose-intolerant to a degree so I don't often drink milk, but the times I have I remember thinking, damn, this is what milk is supposed to taste like! They don't really sell lowfat milk in Japan, so whenever you have a latte or something it's full fat milk. It just tastes very strong in comparison to what I remember having at school lunch in the US.\n\nThere are American things that I can't wait to have upon landing though, like Mexican (ha) and good BBQ. And despite the high sugar content, I have a soft spot for those Wal-Mart sugar cookies with the frosting and sprinkles.",
      "Absolutely. Mainly it's ingredients and cooking methods that aren't readily available outside of their origin country. \n\nThe most top of mind example I can think of is Vietnam. Vietnamese food outside of Vietnam just isn't the same. It's a combination of environment, ingredients, and preparation methods, and I've never seen it replicated. Thai food is very similar for me as well. Add to that dishes that just don't get made outside of the country, and that the dishes that do always get adjusted for local tastes and, yeah, it tastes different there. \n\nI find this a lot less noticable with European food, because the ingredient and preparation overlap is very high, so I look for dishes that aren't really represented outside of their home countries for whatever reason.",
      "I\u2019ve been to about 11 countries, and I think it has more to do with how different countries have preference for seasonings and flavors rather than the actual product.\n\nThere is a longstanding trope about American food being inferior, and a lot of people propagate it. Also a lot of Americans like to project it too and exaggerate - some of us can be pretentious about traveling. Everything does taste better on vacation, and people like to feel exclusive like they had something on their trip that others haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve had some amazing food while traveling that was made a lot more special because of the environment. I\u2019ve had some food that didn\u2019t impress. I\u2019ve had some really nice local stuff that I would search out when I got back home.\n\nGranted, I\u2019m in California and I think we have a lot of access to great produce. And being in a major city, we have insane logistics to get so many products, fresh and imported. I love trying local cuisine when traveling. After a couple weeks, I\u2019m usually ready to get back home and eat some of the stuff we have here.",
      "Food tastes different when I go to Las Vegas.",
      "I\u2019m the AH here for lazily reading the title and seeing \u201cDog food tastes different in other countries\u201d. Carry on.",
      "I agree, it does taste differently. Some of it is probably seasoning, I think a lot of it is that other countries have more restrictions on chemical use and hormones in food.",
      "Yes, food tastes different to me outside of the US.  We were in Australia last year and noticed it so much.  The hot dog buns at a BBQ were store bought but tasted homemade.  Even the Pringles were better!",
      "Food laws vary by country among other factors. If you\u2019re in the US, look at the difference between Fruit Loops cereal in Canada vs US as an example. Dairy is also much different due to the many rules.",
      "Yes. I used to work on cruise ships and there is a noticeable difference in taste and overall quality of the food we sourced from the US vs. the food sourced from Europe. \n\nThe ships that sailed Europe had better food every time.",
      "Food most definitely tastes different. These are just some of my personal experiences/generalizations:\n\n- Butter in Mexico tastes incredibly different than in Canada, so anything made with it will be different\n\n- some countries put WAY more sugar in their sauces etc (for example I can\u2019t eat store bought tomato sauce in Australia- way too sweet)\n\n- some countries put more spices.. or way less (sorry, looking at you UK and the \u2018Cajun chicken\u2019 I had)\n\n- availability of produce and/or spices or type of meat (bison burgers, kangaroo, seafood) is localized\n\n- a lot of North American food is a bastardized version of ethnic food: Tex-mex, take out Chinese food, Thai curries, Indian butter chicken, sushi",
      "Wife and I Just got back from Argentina; we\u2019ve are a mixed ethnic;  we\u2019ve come to the conclusion that food in the US in general is better quality and more diverse than anywhere else;  we regularly eat American, Italian, Cuban, Mexican, Mediterranean , Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese.  Mexico is probably a distant second.\n\nFor those who have the resources are but prefer just a few cuisines, why?",
      "Prepared foods yes, raw ingredients no when you're comparing equal freshness \n\nPeople who think that food inherently tastes better when they travel are usually people that can't/don't cook and aren't used to eating such fresh meals, or they're eating cuisines and seasonings that they're not used to\n\nI live in Canada, used to live in the US, and I cook 90% of my food fresh my scratch with minimal use of highly processed stuff. I don't find food to be univerally better when I travel, and in some places it's actually (i have to go to Scandinavia every year for work, and i find their food to be way oversalted and way underseasoned compared to what i get locally in Montreal). When i find food is better when traveling, it's due to things like better techniques (like obviously in Italy they have better pasta-making skills than in Canada) and the use of ingredients that aren't widely available where I live (like a type of cactus I ate in Mexico)\n\nAnother factor is freshness. Produce tastes better when it's fresher, and the closer you live to warm agriculture zones the fresher things will be. For example in much of Europe, produce is traveling a much shorter distance to the store than in most of Canada, so most of their stuff tastes better. But it's not any better when compared to equally fresh things, like the stuff I get from a local farm in the summer. In that same vein, when I've traveled to California I also find their produce way better than what I can get in Canada or even northern Europe, and on-par with southern & central Europe. Another example, the worst grocery shopping experience ive ever had was Bermuda in the winter, which is an isolated island where everything has to get shipped in super long distance",
      "Some foods do! The feta in Greece is superior to the US as are the olives. The Prawns in Mauritius were delicious! The rice in Bali-incredible! And Thailand~outstanding and beautiful!y prepared\u2026 so fresh! And I can never drink Guinness anywhere but Ireland! So, some foods most certainly!",
      "Food quality laws are much weaker in the US than in Europe.  This was even a big issue in Brexit, with the UK being worried that they would have to import chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef from the US after losing access to the EU market.",
      "These is a lot of misinformation about food quality in the United States. Unfortunately, biased people continue this farce that american food is somehow worse or fake. It's not.",
      "Do you smoke? Yes, it might be your food palate, as you say. My wife is far more discriminating in her senses of taste and smell than I am (to the point of disagreement I might add). That said, we both like to go to Europe because we think the food is better there. Much better.\n\nIn the US some food in restaurants (especially big chains) is preprocessed and frozen and lacks flavor. And yes, the recipes are different so that ingredients/flavoring and cooking make a difference. My pet peeve in American restaurants is the practice of way overusing hot pepper. I suppose it's a carry over from Mexican and/or Indian food, which are popular. But come on, some places use hot pepper on almost everything.",
      "Of course it does. Their spices may have the same name but they\u2019re quite different. Veggies are grown in different soil, livestock is raised differently. Food is less frozen and more fresh abroad. Of course it tastes different. It IS different.",
      "I\u2019m in Cape Verde now and the food is pretty terrible.  They have no idea how to season or use spices",
      "I love American Chinese food but did not enjoy anything I ate while in China.\n\nI also really liked Ethopian food in Ethiopia, but do not like any of the Ethiopian food I've had in America",
      "Depending on where you're from in the US, Polish culture and cuisine integrated pretty well with a large chunk of the Midwest for example. I'm not saying pierogis in Poland aren't very good, but they probably aren't going to give you a life altering food experience.",
      "I rented an Airbnb for a month in the heel of Italy last fall. As it came with a kitchen I cooked all my own meals. I shopped at the nearby supermarket and the weekly fresh market. \n\nThe food was all different. Dairy tasted fresher and different; makes sense as the cows would be eating local grain. The meats were fresh and tender. The supermarkets didn\u2019t have pre-cut and packaged chicken or meat trays. If you wanted hamburger, you asked the butcher to grind some ground round for you. The veggies and fruits were locally grown, even the herbs I used. It all added up to better (and healthier?) meals for a month!",
      "Yes. See, even in each country the Flavor profile changes simply because the people there have different tastes. For example, in places like the UK, things like mexican food for some reason tend to be more sweet while in the  US are savory and umami while in mexico tend to be more spicy, savory and umami. Same dishes",
      "I think a couple things are in fact different, and often better outside of the US (on average).  Produce seems to be better most of the EU and I think that comes down to where food comes from.  A lot of produce in the US travels a long distance to get to a supermarket - tomatoes from south america and mexico in grocery stores in NY.  Its hard to find local produce unless you specifically search for it.  Generally, produce from far away is picked early and artificially ripened or uses varieties better for shipping than flavor.  Meat in general I find the same with the exception of a lot more lamb than in the US.  In terms of eating out, I think it depends - you can find much more variety in the US but the quality varies just as much.  The best restaurants I've had overseas and the best restaurants i've had in the US are comparable, low end stuff tends to be better elsewhere.  I think US food uses way too much salt and sugar to hide crap ingredients.",
      "It definitely does. The person preparing that food definitely impacts it but so do the farmers and terroir",
      "Fruits and vegetables taste better. In the US in think that they have been so genetically modified that they lost flavor. They taste like fruits and vegetables tasted when I was a kid. Dairy products also taste better in the UK. We also have so many preservatives is food that is a problem too.",
      "Like your question. IMO food in the US isn't as good as it used to be, nor is it as good as most of Europe.  The meat processors add so much water the aromatics in meat evaporate. Produce is bred for looks and shelf life over taste.   Pink slime isn't allowed in much of the EU.",
      "I left the US because the food tastes so disgusting there and after living abroad for sometime I couldn\u2019t go back",
      "Yes, food tastes different to me outside of the US.  We were in Australia last year and noticed it so much.  The hot dog buns at a BBQ were store bought but tasted homemade.  Even the Pringles were better!",
      "I was in Malaysia a few years ago and was shocked at how delicious and fresh and flavorful the food was AND it sparked food memories for me\u2026 that food USED to taste that was in the United States but doesn\u2019t anymore. I had delicious, fresh, not processed food in Croatia that was similarly delicious and flavorful. I don\u2019t know how, but the US food system has removed flavor in the past 20-30 years.",
      "American food is oversaturated with oils, dressings, and other garbage.\u00a0 Ultrasugared to hell and ultraprocessed.\u00a0 You feel nauseous from sugar with consumption of one bakery item.\n\n\nAny other country's bakeries have reasonably sugared desserts.\u00a0 Food is less processed and not drenched in oils and fats.\u00a0 Food is seasoned reasonably and not overseasoned to hell.\u00a0 Soups taste great and are not salt water.",
      "Yes, food tastes different to me outside of the US.  We were in Australia last year and noticed it so much.  The hot dog buns at a BBQ were store bought but tasted homemade.  Even the Pringles were better!",
      "Yes! My wife's from Central America and the food there is amazing, so much more flavor!  It's all seasonal and most things only have a season of a month or two and are practically unavailable outside it. We've talked about it a bunch, and we both agree that US food is all about quantity, not quality.  Sure, you can get blackberries in Texas in November, but they taste like nothing! Meanwhile in El Salvador fruits like jocotes have a good month, mangos have a good couple of months, etc. And the meat is so much tastier in her country because it's not grown so fast just to get slaughtered. They don't need to add tons of sugar and salt and flavoring to make up for the lack of quality. The chips there even have almost no salt and are delicious.",
      "Yes, absolutely. Fruits, meats,breads are all better abroad. This makes me think of my hunny & I\u2019s guilty pleasure travel meal\u2026 American fast food- KFC to be specific! \n\nWe definitely enjoy having native foods/recipes to where we go but we once needed a quick option before our flight home. We gambled on KFC and since then have made it a silly thing we do when away together. We very rarely eat fast food stateside these days but remembered our childhood favorite.\n\nIt was succulent abroad!!Even the side items are deliciously memorable.\n\nIn France, Greece, Italy, Turkey. Also as close as Puerto Rico(I know it\u2019s technically in US)\n\nThe quality of the meat is always noticeably better & the seasonings have been reminiscent of the original recipe (IYKYK). It\u2019s also prepared in a way that it\u2019s not so greasy/oily with any fat rendered as it should be\n\nWe were so shocked that we\u2019ve joked to reach out to headquarters and let them know that they are leaving big money on the table cutting quality for profit or whatever they\u2019re doing stateside because something is definitely different abroad!"

      "I love India but it definitely is another world and can be intimidating.  As a Nordic looking white lady traveling alone, I received some long stares.  I cannot tell you how many people roped me into their family photos for some unknown reason.    I found India loud, colorful, crowded, rich, poor, frenetic and peaceful.  It is the sort of place that requires total immersion.  Anything less will not yield a love match.  I would caution against planning a hermetically sealed trip that focuses on western hotels, private tours, etc.  You will miss the best of India if you take that route.  I was extremely fortunate to arrange a couple of meetings with Indians before I left home.  One happened by chance through LinkedIn.  I answered a question to which an Indian man responded.  He ended up introducing me to several folks in Mumbai who became my local friends.  All of them were excited to share aspects of the culture with me.  Rashi took me shopping and threw a party for me.  Ronan took me for a food tour of Bandra that culminated in dinner at a Parsi restaurant.  Mohit took me shopping and on to a pre-wedding celebration held on a rooftop surrounded by swaying palms.  When I contracted pneumonia and developed a pneumothorax, Mohit took me to his doctor and came to see me everyday while I was in the hospital.  He is still a dear friend.  Sumit made sure I made it safely to the airport in my weakened state.  I met a group of women through a shared love of fiber arts.  Three of them took me shopping and showered me with small gifts over an afternoon of knitting together.  Another knitter asked me to come to her home for dinner, later revising the invitation to include having me as a house guest and showing me things I would never have seen about her region had I been the typical tourist.  The human connections I was blessed to make with Indians and the things they were generous enough to share with me were hands down the best parts of my trip.    Some not great things happened as well.  I expect that with any long trip but they were far and away eclipsed by the wonderful experiences I had seeing not only the typical sites, but the things Indians were proud to show me.    If you are open to it, you will find magic, beauty and grace in India.   Indians are incredibly generous if you just take the time to form real bonds with some of the locals.",

Your suggestions about private everything is spot on. The looks I got from people especially the men was truly unnerving and rattling. I was happy that I was with an Indian Tour Company and our guide told me what how to handle the situation. Also if it wasn't for people wanting to touch me, touch my hair (locs), and rub my skin to see if my melanin would come off. I mean there were native Indians DARKER than me but I was the attraction??!! The food was AMAZING and I will leave it at that and I put India on the same list as China when I visited The Great Wall of China. I give people grace in foreign countries as they may have never seen an actual Black person in well person (pun intended) but the touching and grabbing is just too much....Also Petra was AMAZING in Jordan and I will most definitely go back again when the opportunity arises.",

You'll get the best fish curries in Kerala and South Karnataka.\u00a0\n\n\nThe western ghats are amongst the most unique regions in terms of biodiversity and you have a lot of small and private nature hotels that will organise forest treks. You can go to wildlife sanctuaries as well. Plus there are multiple hilly areas you can visit.\u00a0\n\n\nIn Karnataka, you have Hampi and the surrounding region for ancient architecture. In Tamil Nadu, there are so many temples - Chidambaram, Madurai, kanchipuram, Tanjore, Kanyakumari, etc.\n\n\nAs these states are relatively more developed compared to the north, you have decent highways, good hotels, nicer people, and cleaner cities & towns.\u00a0",
      "This will likely be your experience in a lot of developing countries. I'm a white man but I still experienced being stared at or treated as a source of money to be mined.the pollution, feeling of sketchiness. And the questionable food safety. This was the case in Morocco, Egypt, and India (all three are the only developing countries I've been to).",
      "I spent 2 weeks in Madya Pradesh, India, visiting national parks. It was incredible doing all the safaris. Seen 21 tigers, 2 leopards, and 3 sloth bears. Air was clean, hardly a tourist around. Amazing food. Then spent 2 days in Delhi & Agra at the end of the trip to see the Taj Mahal, and it was all too much for me. I'm not much of a city person to begin with, but I can't imagine staying in the cities longer than we did.",
      "Totally agree. The staring felt predatory. Young children (like age 4) would jump on the side of moving vehicles begging for money. Inexperienced travelers should really consider a tour guide.\n\nFood was the best I\u2019ve ever had though (I have such amazing memories of the guided street food tour). Just incredible flavors. It\u2019s worth dealing with everything else for that alone.",
      "Visiting Delhi and then dismissing the while of India would be similar to visiting Miami and then dismissing the whole of the US.\n\nNote, am not saying Delhi is like Miami, just that it's a huge country with different languages, foods, terrains, etc",
      "I've wanted to visit India in the past because I love the food and their national monuments look amazing but everyone that I know that has been there does not recommend it. Everyone describes it as too dirty to visit. There's no sense of personal space or that it just smells bad everywhere you go. I don't think i'll ever visit since there's so many other places on Earth I'd go before.",
      "If you think you got stared at a lot, ask any blonde woman who has been to India.\n\nI know two Latina women who went to southern India and went to the beach. Guys were being creepy as hell to them.\n\nThat said I'd love to see India one day.\n\nDid you have any stomach issues from the food?",
      "Been three times, including with the local. Number one. You will get sick from the food, chew. It\u2019s hustle culture. Everybody, that\u2019s just the obvious suspects like taxi drivers and the homeless, will try to hustle you for money. They do it to the locals too, you have to learn to turn it off.",
      "Well i think India is a very polar opposite country, well thanks for giving us a chance and visiting, hope you liked the food though",
      "I'm Chinese and visited Mumbai and I tried to go off the beaten track as much as I could.\n\nSimilar to your experience it can leave you very self-concious but I learnt to just embrace it for what it was. \n\nThe environmental catastrophe - litter, air, food, sound pollution - was overwhelming at times, but I tried to look past it and appreciate what I could, the people are incredibly resilient and made the most of their situation.\n\nI can't wait to go back and explore places like Varanasi,  Aurangabad and other places now that I know what to expect.",
      "Yes we experienced similar when we visited about 15 years ago as a white couple.  I don\u2019t remember the staring so much as being a constant target for touts constantly following us trying to sell something. Part of the fun of international travel is trying to blend in and absorb the culture, which is impossible to do.\n Part of it is probably the region that we visited which seems similar to where you were. We did Taj Mahal, Jaipur and Delhi. If I could do it over again I would do the south and maybe go with Indian American friends of ours. But probably won\u2019t go back.\n I tell people that if that if they want to visit India, try Morocco since has the \u201cexotic feel\u201d people expect from India with a bit fewer touts, less garbage and pollution and less food sickness.",
      "Great photos! India is indeed a complex country and culture- so much beauty, amazing food and music, but the worst poverty and filth I\u2019ve ever seen. One and done for me too but so glad to have had the experience.",
      "Some of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met where in India, and the food was good. But damned if I don\u2019t ever want to go back.",
      "Incredible pictures, truly something. I am wondering what camera gear do you use? \n\nAlso, what did you think of the food? One of the most appealing aspects of visiting new places, and i am wondering how different it is to what we are used to in the Western world (I would imagine very different)",
      "I'm sorry you faced all that- Indians do that with foreign tourists. Most of the issues you listed are because of lack of education due to rampant poverty. And also the pathetic government.\n\nI'd like to say that India is very very very diverse - not just in culture, food, language, religion, geography but also all the things you mentioned. Many parts of North India are too polluted and dirty, but the South is much better.\n\nI'd suggest traveling to the North East or the South instead. In the North, go to Ladakh - it's totally diametrically opposite. It'll be a very different experience.",
      "The extremes have the best kind of people in India. The northernmost parts, Ladakh, Manali to the north eastern parts of Meghalaya, and the southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. They also have the best scope for nature exploration and hygienic surroundings and food. So it\u2019s best to avoid the middle chunk completely on your next visit and sure enough you\u2019ll have a different experience. India is so vast and diverse in terms of culture and economy that you need to really research before coming here. All the so called touristy destinations are littered with wastes and ill mannered people as you said but there are many places where the opposite is true.",
      "You missed on getting your food cooked by a guy playing with his toe jam first, all the trash, zero hygiene, total chaos, \u2026 all the honking that will give you ptsd, air pollution that gives the gift of lifetime chronic coughing. And then there\u2019s the shity way public officials handle you and good luck at the airports. You\u2019ll spit on the ground the second you leave and promise yourself not to ever comeback. But the minute you hear a horn back home you\u2019ll be on kayak checking airline tickets.",
      "Nice pictures.  Were you able to avoid the self-appointed \u201cguides\u201d at the Taj Mahal?  I had one guy following me around for half an hour even as I tried telling him I didn\u2019t need or want a guide or photographic helper.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of history to appreciate in India and I enjoyed the food and culture but the pollution was next level, the grifters were annoying, and the visa application felt like I was applying for entry to the CIA or something.  Scratch that, I bet even the CIA doesn\u2019t ask what your grandparents\u2019 professions were.\n\nOn the one hand, I\u2019d sort of like to see southern India but on the other hand, I have no desire to ever fly into Delhi ever again.",
      "You mean you visited Delhi,Rajasthan and decided that\u2019s what India is about while it is well known how the culture, food, people, cleanliness and language changes with each state.",
      "I can totally relate to your comment. \nWhen I was in India I took private guided tours everywhere I go but even so I have witnessed ridiculous amount of garbages everywhere, people throwing garbages on the streets, extreme poverty and crazily rich people throwing the biggest party I\u2019ve ever seen. I saw my acquaintance (Indian) who is from a rich family treat catering staffs badly which was appalling. I saw streets that are full of gorgeous houses for rich people to live in and that are full of garbages and exposed electric wires with homeless kids wondering around begging for food and money, side by side. \nI saw my guide throw garbages on the street and accused him of his doing then he told me that people do that in India because they think they shouldn\u2019t be the one to pick up the garbages and take care of it. \nSome comments recommend people to go to the south or villages but in a village I saw people defecating in public. \nI\u2019m glad I went to India and saw gorgeous building and beautiful culture but I will never go back.",
      "Sorry, I don\u2019t meant to be rude at all, that\u2019s not who I am , and I am willing to take the all the downvotes, but you sound like an entitled prick. Did you take the time to do any research about India before you visited ? Did you not think that you were going to stand up as a tall black man? For you to highly the obvious ( poverty in India , curious people, etc\u2026) makes you sound profoundly ignorant, India does overwhelm the senses, but I am not going to go there to highlight the bad part s of the country, you sound like the typical entitled tourist that only visit famous places. I encourage to get to know a place by getting to know its people, there\u2019s so much beauty and history in India , so many wonderful places to explore and visit. So much good food to be enjoyed, and so many people you can bless and who can bless you. \nIn the middle of the garbage,  and abject poverty, the resilience of the people , and their strong will to survive, shines like a beacon of hope."

      "I love New Mexican food. Chili Verde, Indian tacos, etc.",
      "Tip for NOLA: It has a veritable country\u2019s worth of unique local foods.  You won\u2019t get anywhere near them all.  That\u2019s ok!\n\nThere are so many unique local foods, growing up there I wasn\u2019t sure what was or wasn\u2019t local, lol.\n\nHot sausage patties, for example.  Random south Louisiana food.  Good stuff.\n\nOr doberge cake, a personal favorite of mine.  Had no clue it wasn\u2019t everywhere.\n\nAlso, New Orleans is like bread pudding HQ.  And every. Single. Restaurant. Does it differently.  You could have 100 bread puddings and never repeat, it\u2019s crazy.\n\nGumbo is my overall favorite dish, followed by any of the variations of shrimp/crawfish creole.",
      "Seen a ton of good ones mentioned here. I love Asian food so i love Seattle and San Francisco. \n\nChicago for Italian and pizza. \n\nGlad you\u2019re starting in New Orleans cause i would\u2019ve said that first. \n\nThis is probably a weird one, but the middle eastern food in Detroit is some of my favorite food I\u2019ve ever had. \n\nOh and I\u2019m from Miami, it\u2019s got the regular foodie scene but with the best Cuban and South American food you can get domestically.",
      "Chicago, it always seems to be the forgotten city on this list but the food goes way beyond Deep dish and Italian Beef.  Chicago was started as and still is a major transportation hub for food which gives them access to tons of great ingredients.  It is also has one of the major immigrant communities in the world plus it was one of if the the largest locations where southern blacks resettled bringing with them basically the best food from the south.  Add in something like 200 breweries in the metro and you will never run out of places to eat.",
      "Minneapolis/St Paul: Owamni by The Sioux Chef for Native. And a host of excellent German, Hmong, Japanese, Latin American, Korean, Vietnamese, Ukrainian, French, and American steak restaurants to chose from. Grab some unique Scandinavian food at the American Swedish Institute and Museum. Work off your delicious meals by renting kayaks/canoes, walking around one of the many parks, and touring the flour museum/stone bridge.  The twin cities are so culturally diverse with amazing restaurants. Head on up to Duluth for more Minnesota cuisine.  \n\nIt\u2019s not just cheese curds and hotdishes in Minnesota!",
      "Los Angeles is my current favorite food city. You can spend $3 or $300 and have amazing food. So much good Mexican food and from across Latin America. Great hot dogs! These donut/boba tea combo places are amazing sources of cheap food that I don't know why they aren't all across the US. I had great sushi while I was there. Great crepes! The fruit cutters in the tourist districts are really good too (though you have to find the guys cutting the fruit to-order, not using pre-cut fruit). The Thai food. The diners! I mean I could go on, but LA really does have something for everyone.\n\nAnd honestly, I went in the middle of summer and did not make a single reservation. I think with how spread out many things are, that helps keeps the crowds down. Now yeah stuff does get busy on weekends but if you're willing to wait and aren't a huge group, it usually isn't too bad.",
      "New Orleans is an awesome start. As a Houston resident, I could recommend coming here after. If you\u2019re driving it\u2019s a 5 hour shot down I-10 west. Tex Max, BBQ, Viet-Cajun are the foods they do best.",
      "Don\u2019t sleep on Houston! One of the biggest and most diverse cities in the US and it shows in their culinary scene. Just a hop away from NOLA too (which would of course be on the top of my list). I also loooove the food scene in Chicago, fairly affordable, big portions, great Italian and Polish spots, cool New American, and really fun drink spots if that\u2019s your thing (like The Aviary)",
      "Philly has an amazing food scene, it\u2019s not just cheesesteaks, many new innovative chefs, James Beard Noms etc.\nDenver/Boulder Colorado is also a great scene, some avant garde, some native foods, great Mexican food, and so much more.",
      "No love for the upcoming scene in Detroit. They are killing it there with Middle Eastern, Polish, Italian and mixed Eastern European cuisine.\n\n\nThe biggest problem is these wonderful foods are getting siloed and not doing great fusion.\n\n\nHonolulu is a melting pot that has stayed molten for several decades.",
      "You should do a food marathon in Houston TX. Less expensive than LA and NY with all of the exposure of a large melting pot of cultures and variety of cuisines. Every type of American, plus large Hispanic and Asian populations as well as sizable African American, Indian, Vietnamese, Filipino, Korean, Middle Eastern and European communities.",
      "Charleston food scene is fantastic",
      "New Mexico 100% you can\u2019t find anything else like it in the United States. Check out Santa Fe, a really cute city with lots of great food!",
      "Chicago has some of the best restaurants in the country. there are so many amazing restaurants that you can just toss a dart and you'll land on one. I'm from here, I've traveled a lot, I can honestly say nothing beats this city's food scene.",
      "Santa Fe.\n\nAlso, I've been to 49/50 states and ate Mexican in most of them, and plenty in different places in Mexico. Chicago has the best Mexican food outside of Mexico",
      "Ropa Vieja in Miami & the Florida Keys. All Cuban food there, really. Also, key lime pie in the Keys!",
      "San Francisco has incredible food!  And it\u2019s a beautiful city.",
      "CHICAGO has the BEST food in the US HANDS DOWN.",
      "Seafood.   Drive the coast from Newport, RI, to Boston, to Gloucester, to Kennbebunk, to Portland, to Arcadia National Park.  Scenic beauty, history, great fresh seafood.  Lobster, scallops, oysters, clams, mussels, haddock, cod, bluefish, flounder, monkfish, squid.  Boiled, baked, steamed, grilled, chowder, and fried.  Washed down with local ciders and beers.",
      "Got.to.have.amish.food.\nAmish restaurants and I'm not talking about Friendly's. I'm talking about like you go to Lancaster PA and you find a tiny spot with Amish eating there and then you go there. I cannot even explain you have to see for yourself.",
      "Charleston, the best seafood \ud83d\ude0b\nNashville offers an interesting scene too",
      "San Francisco is always a fun place and great foodie town. Seafood.",
      "Houston for Asian and Mexican food",
      "Every major city in the country has good food.  Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",
      "Washington, DC has a truly great food scene.  \nBest old school steakhouse with black tie piano player: The Prime Rib.  Do dessert - pecan pie a la mode.\n\nBeat Peruvian place with incredible vibe:  El Secreto de Rosita.  Art work on the walls is a bonus. \n\nBest Italian place with fun feel:  Filomena\n\nBest local farm to table:  Founding Farmers where everything is made from scratch.  \n\nBest wood-fired proteins and breads: Opal.\n\nBest neighborhoods for foodie finds and small restaurants that rock:  Adams Morgan and Shaw\n\nBest breakfast bread and pastries:  A Baked Joint\n\nSo much more but this is just a sample.",
      "Tanta and el Che in Chicago\n\nRebirth and baru bistro in New Orleans\n\nChubby fish in New Orleans\n\nPortland Oregon, the food pods/carts are a ton of fun to explore. Bar Casa Vale is my favorite sit down",
      "I\u2019ve lived/travelled to almost all of these places, currently live in Nola. I would say 100% it depends on your palate. While Nola food can be amazing, I find the food offerings in NyC much better for my taste buds (I don\u2019t care for super spicy/fried food). This is great opportunity and I wish you the best!",
      "I loved the food in Nashville. Hattie Bs BBQ\u2026 omg. Also ate at a place called Folk, which had some beautiful dishes.\n\nThe food in Philly was incredible\u2026 lots of ethic foods. Mediterranean, Vietnamese, Jerusalem bagels, which I\u2019ve never tried before. Bonus was a meal at a town on the outskirts of Philly called \u201cStella of New Hope\u201d\u2026 that might have been the best meal I\u2019ve ever had.",
      "San Francisco has great food. The restaurants in Chinatown are amazing.",
      "TUCSON!  I should point that Tucson is a UNESCO City of Gastronomy for it's Sonoran style food.",
      "Las Vegas!! Such a high end foodie situation there plus of course awesome cheap eats Mexican places.",
      "I\u2019m coming in out of left field but the food scene in Dallas is amazing. Has everything, reasonable prices, and easy to get into most restaurants.",
      "People might think I\u2019m crazy but I\u2019ve lived all over the country, and Detroit is one of the best places for food, and cocktails",
      "I suggest Mexican, Korean, and Japanese food in Los Angeles, but the food scene is on par with New York for most cuisines and arguably more varieties exist there than in New York if you discuss regional specialties.  Mexican is ubiquitous throughout the country, but the consensus is that it is garbage in most places outside of southern California. There, real Mexicans are making fantastic food with quality ingredients.  Korean barbecue in Los Angeles is bigger than it is in most of South Korea, and especially try the LA style kalbi which is what South Koreans praise.  \n\nSalmon sushi is better on the west coast and the envy of sushi chefs in Japan, however Japan rules for tuna.  Every conversation I have had in Japan with sushi chefs is gushing about how good American tuna sushi is and how terrible it is in Japan.  There are also legit traditional Japanese restaurants that aren't sushi and teriyaki bowls throughout Los Angeles (though Seattle is probably king for teriyaki bowls).  San Francisco - go for cioppino, Dungeness crab, sourdough bread, and a mission burrito.\n\nTexas is a fantastic place to get barbecue.  I like Terry Black's if you can find your way there.  Tex Mex is great as long as you accept you aren't eating Mexican food but something entirely different.  If you want burgers, steaks, and fried fare, Texas is a great place for that sort of cooking.  This also kind of applies most places in its immediate vicinity and going north from it.  Austin has a lot of great restaurants and Vietnamese food is particularly good in Houston.\n\nNew Orleans is part of the gulf coast and I think has the best American food culture, so I think you will find it amazing.  In four days, you could have 8 lunch and dinner meals, so I would suggest BBQ shrimp, Oysters Rockefeller, gumbo, jambalaya, a crawfish boil, po' boys, etouffee, and a muffaletta.  But you can get some great stuff going east all the way to the Atlantic Coast with South Carolina.  Seafood is great coastally, especially shrimp and grits, but also fried chicken, catfish, okra, ham, sweet tea, collard greens and pies are the way to go.  Lemon pepper wings too!  \n\nAs an added bonus, down in Miami, you have fantastic Cuban food.\n\nI haven't spent too much time on the east coast outside of Virginia, Washington DC, and Maryland, which doesn't have anything I would rave about, but if you find yourself in New England crab and lobster dishes are king, like lobster rolls and crab cakes.  Clam chowder is also great there - many prefer New England style, but I like Manhattan and Rhode Island style clam chowders myself because I am not into cream + seafood.\n\nChicago has good Italian inspired food, and I love deep dish pizza more than other kinds, personally.",
      "Oh for sure Hawaii. They are pretty much the origin point of \"American Japanese\" food.\n\nHibachi, Poke Bowls, Sushi, Teriyaki. It's all fantastic there.\n\nThey also have lots of authentic Asian restaurants you will struggle to find elsewhere in USA, and unique Hawaiian fusion cuisine that is wholly unique to Hawaii: a blend of Chinese, Portugese, Japanese, Filipino, and American foods.",
      "If you're hitting all 50 states, then don't miss Birmingham, AL. Punches WAY above its weight in good food ranging from street dogs to fine dining and has a ton of really cool bars.\u00a0\n\n\nCheck out the OG Doe's Eat Place in Mississippi.\u00a0\n\n\nGet up to Burlington, VT. Go to Hen of the Wood.\u00a0\n\n\nKansas City for BBQ, obviously.",
      "California has the best food in the country. San Francisco especially. Avoid Seattle the food is bad and very expensive.",
      "Foodies tend to vary, I place a lot on experience.\n\nAtlanta, Ga: Waffle House hash browns, ask the \u201cwaitress\u201d the best way and go with the Flow. Preferably between 10pm and 5am.\n\nCincinnati: skyline chilli: see above. Go with the flow.\n\n\nSavannah, GA: oyster in a bucket from a dive bar on the port.\n\nCalifornia: in n out burger\u2026 ask for a 4x4\n\nAnywhere: dinners that look dodgy and have best up cars parked there. Local plates. Will be a life experience.\n\n\nI\u2019ve been to countless places that have \u2728 including Jules Verne, but in the USA you want to experience the culture with the food.

      "I think NOLA has the most overrated food. Never understand the hype about the food there. \n\nProbably LA and New York.",
      "The US is a melting pot so one of treats is the variety of food. I live in Seattle and we can find food from almost any region of the world nearby, but there are few distinct \"U.S. foods\" in my opinion outside of a hamburger, BBQ or Cajun (so good bet on New Orleans). That said, we have some amazing restaurants! Find the chefs that embrace fusion, combining the taste of different regions with the food that is local and you'll be in a good place!  This is a big country so think about the food you want and then find the chefs - ex. Seattle = Salmon, oysters, halibut, where Texas = beef, NYC = everything :). Have fun!",

      "I love food too much, and I'm fairly well traveled. \n\nNew Orleans, Charleston, Sante Fe are definitely stand outs to me (for *smaller\" locations, in that order). Personally the food scene in Savannah has never stood out to me when compared to Charleston but it's vibe is still nice (the design of the city with the squares, dating back to 17th century). It's a neat city to be a tourist in.\n\n But I have to absolutely echo the Santa Fe love. I went for New Years randomly once, and really loved it. \n\nAnd New Orleans is legendary for obvious reasons. I'd just say visit when it's not so oppressively hot.",

It's one of the most diverse cities in the country and, as a result, has one of the most diverse food scenes as well. Particular strengths in terms of cuisine include Tex-Mex, Mexican, Vietnamese, Indian, Texas BBQ, Cajun, and Mediterranean/Middle Eastern cuisine. Interesting fusion cuisines as well like Viet-Cajun. Restaurants in Houston are also noticeably less expensive than other major food destinations.\n\nChicago is great in terms of variety as well as iconic local food dishes like Chicago pizza.\n\nDetroit has some amazing food destinations \u2013 Dearborn has some of the best Middle Eastern food in the country. Eastern Market is one of the largest public markets in the U.S.\n\nIf you like cheese, Wisconsin (lots of great places across the whole state) is a must.",

      "If you\u2019re going to every state, in Indiana you have to go to Indianapolis area for food, with two exceptions. Indianapolis has some James Beard winners, and is becoming known for its food scene.  Beholder is considered one of the best but the owner is a horrible person, if that matters to you. Tinker Street, Blue Beard, Milk Toast (brunch), Livery, Provision, Union 50, and Vida are all top notch. Do not let people tell you to go to St. Elmo\u2019s. It\u2019s the oldest steakhouse in Indianapolis, but that doesn\u2019t make it the best. However, they do have one of the best shrimp cocktails ever, if you love horseradish. I would recommend getting that at their bar the 1933 Lounge with a cocktail and having steak elsewhere if you want steak. \n\nThe two exceptions to Indianapolis are Bonge\u2019s Tavern which is close to Indianapolis, but kind of near nothing. People make reservations way in advance and they tailgate until their table is ready. It\u2019s a whole experience. The other exception is Joseph Decius in Roanoke which has Waygu steaks and sources from their own farm. Nick\u2019s Junction is down the street and is considered to have one of the best pork tenderloin sandwiches in the state, which is one of the state foods. Roanoke is a little town outside of Ft. Wayne, IN. \n\nOf places I\u2019ve been NOLA, Chicago, Atlanta, Vegas and Denver (I love the green chili!) are some of my favorite food places. I would also say Napa Valley, but I have not been for probably 7 or 8 years.",

      "Let me say something controversial. The U.S. has the best collection of food anywhere in the world. Because we have so many immigrants, you can find ethnic restaurants in the U.S. that serve food that is just as good as anywhere in the world. In fact, for some the best ethnic restaurants in the U.S. are arguably better than what you find in the original country, simply because we have more money and can afford better ingredients and more protein. No other country comes remotely close in the variety and quality of cuisines. Try finding Asian food in South America or Mexican food in Europe, for example.\n\nThen we have American food or american fusion food, which I think is totally underrated. Texmex in the southwest, all the different regional varieties of BBQ, cajun food, italian american food in the northeast, southern comfort food, etc.",

Oh my goodness - and please believe the local when they say it\u2019s spicy. \nI was way over my head, I love spicy food, have been eating them since I was a little kid and I kid you not, I have eyebrow sweat eating this jigae at a small shop with Korean Uncles with no tourist in sight. \nBut, I finished it cause it\u2019s damn good and I\u2019m stubborn. \n\nHope you have a great time!",
      "I'm with you, and I spend as much if not more time researching food as I do attractions when I travel.  And while I think those people are being a little closed-minded by saying food travelers are strange, at the same time, I mean, not everyone is a foodie.  I definitely know people who are picky eaters even with their home cuisines, like people who won't eat mushrooms, or fish, or certain vegetables, and so on.  Asking those people to be adventurous about food when they're abroad is definitely asking too much; they're just going to be miserable.  I mean that's fair, we like what we like and I want everyone to enjoy their vacations.  Luckily in my own case, I'm never with someone so picky that we completely can't eat the local food, like I'm never forced to go to Hard Rock Cafe or whatever.",
      "Food is usually the thing I look forward to most when travelling. Favourite destination: Thailand. I know there are many beautiful and interesting things in Ireland or Belize but it's much hard to get excited about them when the food is known for being bland.",
      "I come from the other side of things huh, reading this thread is really interesting, because I don\u2019t travel for food. Restaurants are expensive and I\u2019m a somewhat picky eater, and all that hassle plus navigating foreign restaurants and dining customs stresses me out. If I was traveling with someone else, I would be open to it, but given I travel solo, it\u2019s just one more thing to worry about. I\u2019ve been to Spain a bunch but I\u2019ve never actually had Tapas or Paella because those feel like more social type meals and it feels awkward to go into a bar solo. I\u2019m going to go Paris this winter and try to push past the stress and try local foods but we\u2019ll see how that goes.",
      "If you want truly authentic Korean food, avoid places that are popular on social media. Those places either cater to tourists and foreigners or a very young demographic; the food will not be as good. Koreans also don't really use Google, so take Google reviews with a grain of salt. Good restaurants often have average ratings on Google, in the 3 star range, so don't be dissuaded by the ratings. Michelin star guides are not helpful in Korea in my experience. Additionally, most cafes in Korea emphasize vibes and desserts over coffee, so finding good coffee will take some effort. \n\nSince you're going in the winter, make sure to try fresh seafood and hot soups/stews. Hwe is expensive in Seoul compared to the coast, but will be worth it. If you're adventurous, try live octopus. (No, it's not actually alive and is NOT animal cruelty. The nerves in the octopus still twitch after it dies, hence the \"live\" appearance.) Korea has a lot of seafood dishes. My favorites include agwi jjim (braised spicy angler), nakji bokkeum (stir fried squid), haemul jjim (spicy braised seafood), and godeungeo jorim (braised mackerel). Some of my favorite soups/stews are seonji haejangguk (oxblood hangover soup), biji jjigae (ground soybean stew), yukgaejang (spicy beef stew), miyeok guk (seaweed soup), kongnamul guk (soybean sprout soup), and kkori gomtang (oxtail soup). \n\nAs a side note, bakeries will be very different from the typical Western bakery. Bread is a snack/dessert in Korea, so breads tend to be sweet.",
      "Its odd, I love to cook. I like trying new recipes, but when I travel I am rarely blown away by what I find food wise. The only exception really is heading next door to France for their cheese, wine and bread. Every where else, the food has been serviceable and sometimes delicious. But never much to write home about. I liked the Bahn Mi in Vietnam, but I liked Bahn Mi before I went to Vietnam. Thailand was fine. Peru was fine, Argentina was fine. I still have to go to Mexico. I am wondering if I am just too cheap. I see travel shows where they eat all this amazing food, then I get there and realise they were at high end Michelin star restaurants or TikTok trends and the food is 5X the cost of other local restaurants and so I don't eat there.",

So I guess it\u2019s all very dependent on the individual.",

      "I don't think it's strange that people do. But it has absolutely no influence on my travelling experiences at all. I've gone to certain places and just ate fast food every day, doesn't bother me at all. \n\nIf it were possible to take a tablet prior to travel which meant I didn't need to eat (but had none of the negative consequences of that) I would take it without question as it would give me more time to go exploring and do more things. \n\nI guess for me, if you really want to try a culinary experience, there is normally nothing stopping you from getting the necessary ingredients and making it yourself at home. But I can't transport the Eiffel Tower into my kitchen.",

But trying to travel while treating food as something to handle cheaply or quickly can leave you feeling worse off if you are compounding a lousy day with a lousy meal, or you could get more stressed out if you lack ideas or direction.  \n\nHaving some ideas for dining gives you a bit more flexibility in checking things off your list - you could have a screwed up travel day with delays, resulting in you checking into your hotel at 630pm instead of 1100am, but you could still go to a place on your list for dinner and get a sense of achievement in doing something you wanted to do.\n\nBasically, for me at least, having some ideas about dishes/places to eat gives me more at bats - more opportunities for things to do. \n\nAnyhow:\nhttps://guide.michelin.com/en/seoul-capital-area/kr-seoul/restaurant/ggupdang  \n\nIf you eat pork, this is a great pork BBQ place in Gangnam that has no issues with solo diners.",

      "I definitely do not travel to a location because of the food. However, when I do go to a foreign place, I try the local food. But there are exceptions. I cannot eat spicy at all, but I love going to India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and China. Finding food I can eat is actually challenging. So, no, food is not a must.",
      "Food in the Philippines was not great. Cambodia not much better. \n\nThailand is the place to go for great food!",
      "It\u2019s almost as if people are only slightly more intelligent apes, compared to chimps/gorillas, and food is still what most people care most about. Of course most people\u2019s travels are centered on food as they\u2019re largely\njust looking for a different environment to eat in when traveling. Otherwise, everyone would be trying to see something like Everest and it would be insane out there.",
      "Go to the major markets like Dongdaemun and look at all the food stalls,  sit down and try anything that interests you. \n\n\nInsadong is really touristy, but it has a few restaurants that are very traditional with foods that are hard to find elsewhere.  I can't recall the name of the restaurant,  but it was on the serving floor and it's famous for this cold soup in a soy milk broth(?).",

But I heard that Bologna is where Italians go for good Italian food. So I was psyched. I looked at apps, used Google map and did some research. The best food I had there was Indian food. So that told me how important food can be when I am traveling.",
      "Everyone travels for their own reasons. What I find annoying is people who judge others for their travel reasons eg 'omg you aren't adventurous with your eating? Why are you even travelling?' I walk heaps and look at scenery, culture and people and architecture and usually eat eat a lot less than at home (Melbourne Australia international food mecca). Just let everyone travel how they like and don't be a food snob. Japan is my favourite place to travel but I don't really like the food and eat at a lot of Indian places while there.",
      "If you aren't interested in fully immersing yourself in another culture you shouldn't bother that culture with your presence, and food constitutes a HUGE part of culture.  That said, people who travel ONLY for food are part of the problem too.  But a large, large part? Yeah it's weird if you want to go to place X and eat food from back home, and not very responsible!"

It's not even particularly popular among domestic tourists, possibly because it gets really hot here during the summer and is far from any coast. It's an incredibly beautiful city though with a perfectly preserved medieval centre. Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon film there for the street scenes for King's Landing.\n\nThe food scene there is wonderful too, with a focus on quite possibly the finest pork in the world.",
      "George Town and the rest of Penang in Malaysia. If you love food, you'll love it there. Also, it's not a city, but Pangkor Island, also in Malaysia, is a lovely place to relax. I think it's mainly ignored by foreign tourists who go instead to Langkawi, though Pangkor does get a fair amount of domestic tourism. I'm sure that Langkawi is very nice, but it's also pretty expensive, particularly by Malaysian standards. Pangkor is cheap, friendly, and scenic.\n\nJust about any city outside of Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto in Japan. Those are all great places, but if you have the time, you should try to explore the countryside.\n\nAnd I would be remiss if I failed to give a shout out to my hometown of Philadelphia in the US. I get why international tourists would overlook it while visiting NYC and DC, but it's got many of the charms of both of those while being less crowded and less expensive: an amazing variety of museums, world class food and drink, diverse communities, deep history, walkable neighborhoods, lovely parks, etc.",
      "Yerevan. For me it has a feeling of grandeur and coziness at the same time, nice street cafes, good food, and lovely weather.",
      "Ha, my first thoughts upon seeing the title were Tainan and Wroc\u0142aw lol.\n\nI'll add Kochi, India. Beautiful views over the harbour, interesting history and architecture, great food. Kerala as a whole was lovely and when we were there (in 2012), there weren't many other western tourists. Probably more now but I think people are still much more likely to head to Delhi, Mumbai or Goa.",

And we don\u2019t just have a beautiful downtown area with lots of activities, we prioritize nature in our Commonwealth so there are tons of hiking trails and state parks nearby to explore for free fun.\n\n(And you can forage for mushrooms and fruits and berries for personal use on state land. And we don\u2019t have any protected mushrooms that are illegal to collect like in some other countries, so if you\u2019ve ever dreamed of foraging lions mane, just come here in late Autumn. We are entering morel mushroom season right now, and it\u2019s super rainy and was a cold snowy winter so it should be lit.)",

Delicious, gorgeous, comically huge beaches with random shrimp statues, random rehabbed industrial sites, like a building that looks like Homer Simpsons Nuclear Plant that is now an Ikea.  Has a different feel than nearby Chinese cities.  \n\nRavenna, Italy.  Lots of late Roman / Medieval buildings.  Great streets to wander around.  Interesting Medieval stuff too, including Dante's tomb.  The artwork in some of the churches is amazing.  Its crazy this little town was the capital of western civilization for a good amount of time.  Of course its also a short train ride to Bologna or Venice.  \n\nThune, Switzerland.  Like I visited Interlaken, an hated it.  It felt like I was wandering through stupid tourists blowing their money.  Thune had lots of cool shops, and a bunch of restaurants built up on a river /canal.  I loved the food, and had some amazing Thai food of all things.  I'm still salivating over truffle week.  \n\nRabat, Morocco.  National capital yes, but great souk to wander around even though I got into a fist fight.  I tried to buy a Tanjine from a restaurant that they were throwing away, and they just gave it to me.  And nothing better than a 10 pound tanjine.  Since its not visited by tourists, the haggling is less crazy and more getting to know you to make a deal.  I was told I negotiate like a jew.  Oh, they don't know half the story.",

It is extremely underrated. I have never hear of anyone mentioning it except for the few Trans-Siberian travelers who pass through. It\u2019s definitely worth a visit when it is more peaceful.\n\nKuching \u2013 If you\u2019re looking for the best Malaysian or Singaporean food, this should be on your radar. Kuching is easily accessible and offers amenities similar to those in larger regional cities, but it\u2019s much quieter and friendlier. Plus, you can see partially wild orangutans at a nearby reserve. \n\nVictoria, BC \u2013 While everyone talks about Vancouver or Seattle, the most beautiful British-looking city in North America is literally in the same bay. Victoria has fantastic food, friendly people, and world-class museums. It\u2019s not exactly underrated, but I know many people in the PNW who have never visited.\n\nKanazawa/Toyama \u2013 Many of the underrated cities actually make it to the NYT\u2019s annual \"Top 52 Places to Visit\". I took a bullet train along the west coast of Honshu instead of the usual Kyoto-Tokyo route, and was pleasantly surprised by how quiet and charming the area is. It\u2019s full of amenities and delicious food, and we visited a few museums where we were the only visitors that day.\n\nDresden \u2013 Is Dresden underrated? I\u2019m not sure, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be a popular destination, so I\u2019m including it. It has incredible museums (the Green Vault rivals Louvre/Hermitage), lots of Communist-era architecture, delicious food, and very affordable. Moreover it is easy to access beautiful landscapes/castles and into nearby countries.",
      "In the US, I think a lot of the Great Lakes cities get overlooked for international travel - and offer a unique, more affordable, less commercialized slice of our country. With easy access to some incredible nature. Sigh, if anyone ever wants to come visit again \ud83e\udee0\n\n- Milwaukee, Wisconsin is way underrated. Mid-sized industrial city with a thriving food, beer, art, and music scene. Plus it\u2019s a half days drive to the upper peninsula of Michigan which is divine. Quick jaunt to Chicago too. \n\n- Duluth, Minnesota is another one. It\u2019s a small city, so it\u2019s clean and easy to get around - but has a state college so it\u2019s got a great vibrant energy and music scene. Main draw IMO: access to boundary waters canoe area. \n\nI know people would put Minneapolis/St. Paul on the list on of great Midwest cities so I will too. Super green, tons of lakes and public green space, good food scene. St Paul is a little more historic/industrial and Mpls more cosmopolitan, in general. \n\nHonestly though if you visit the Midwest and you sleep on the MN/WI/MI northwoods - you\u2019ve missed the heart of what the region has to offer. Even if you\u2019re not outdoorsy there are some great, vibey little artists towns along Lake Superior/Michigan.\n\n \ud83d\udea9Mandatory to say - these recommendations are summer/fall only. Winter is not for the faint of heart \ud83e\ude75\ud83e\udd76",
      "Merida in the Yuccatan peninsula in Mexico. It gets mostly ignored by tourists visiting Cancun. It is beautiful, safe, and has great museums and food scenes. I even had a Chilaquiles pizza that was to die for! It\u2019s a short drive to the cenotes, ruins, and beaches that the Yuccatan has to offer without all the tourists and party goers. Also very close to Celestun is an amazing beach and nature preserve where we got to see wild flocks of flamingos. I think we paid $75 per night for a 3 bedroom house with pool. Truly an unforgettable vacation and I don\u2019t regret at all not seeing Cancun.",

Meenakshi Temple is mind-blowing and it\u2019s surrounded by this big complex with shops and stuff where motorcycles and cars aren\u2019t allowed (at least, they weren\u2019t when I was there in 2013). There\u2019s a beautiful Murugan temple carved out of rock right outside the city as well.\n\nMuscat, Oman. Gorgeous scenery and has maintained its local culture more than other big cities in the Gulf like, say, Dubai or Doha.\n\nBaku, Azerbaijan. I was so impressed by the number of beautiful, well-kept outdoor spaces. There\u2019s some cool modern architecture but the old city is the most fun area imo.",

Oaxaca has such a vibrant arts and activist community that overlap.",

      "T'bilisi, Georgia (country not state!) Just spent six months there and the city is wonderful and profoundly cheap with amazing food, unique architecture, thriving nightlife, and sulphur baths where an old lady will scrub the dead skin off your body for 5 bucks. Politically not great at the moment though, mostly due to its physical/political proximity to Russia.",

      "Louisville, KY\n\nIt has some great history, food and entertainment! It's the heart of the Bourbon Trail and offers loads of tastings. There's tons of museums and even the largest neighborhood of restored Victorian homes in Old Louisville that are gorgeous. There's also the Waverly Hills Sanitarium if you're into haunted attractions. It's considered one of the most haunted places in the US. Overall a great city and fairly affordable to visit.",
      "Oslo, Norway is very underrated. Usually Norway is known for its beautiful landscape in the Lofoten islands or the fjords on the west coast. However, Oslo has grown to become a very scenic city, with its iconic Opera house in the middle of the city and easily accessible saunas right in the vicinity of the opera house and Oslo fjord area.\n\nAdditionally, Oslo has grown into becoming quite the food hotspot, with everything ranging from 3 star Michelin restaurant Maaemo to great local favorites like Le Benjamin in Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka or Chez Colin in Fredensborg. Also try the coffee at Tim Wendelboe\u2019s in Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka, his coffee got the number 1 spot last year in Roastfuls annual awards, and 5th place this year in @theworlds100bestcoffeeshops. Not to mention Himkok, the most famous bar in Oslo ranked 11th in  @theworlds50bestbars.",
      "There are some stunning U.S. cities that often fly under the radar but are totally worth a visit.\n\nSavannah, Georgia: This charming city is known for its historic architecture, beautiful parks, and a laid-back vibe.\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania: With its impressive skyline and rich history, Pittsburgh offers great museums and outdoor activities along its rivers.\n\nMadison, Wisconsin: A vibrant college town with lovely lakes, great food, and a fantastic bike trail system.\n\nBoise, Idaho: Surrounded by mountains, Boise features a picturesque downtown with walking paths along the river.\n\nLouisville, Kentucky: Famous for its bourbon and the Kentucky Derby, this city has a lively arts scene and beautiful neighborhoods.",
      "A Coru\u00f1a, Spain. It\u2019s beautiful, has great food and beautiful beaches, and is very walkable. \n\nI would also say Oviedo, Spain. I would move there if I could. Asturias is gorgeous. There may not be as much to do from a tourist standpoint but I loved it."

      "If anyone goes to visit Bagan you should dine at a restaurant called Sanon which is a youth training restaurant. From their website:\n\n\"The Sanon Training Restaurant is operated by the MYDI (Myanmar Youth Development Institute). MYDI conducts Sanon as a non-profit social enterprise organization in Nyaung U, Bagan, Myanmar.\n\nOur core strategic aim is to:\n\n\"Train up to 30 students at a time, assist them to gain employment and monitor them for a further two years\"\n\nThe function of the Project via the Sanon Training Restaurant is to train disadvantaged youth in hospitality and English, find them employment and monitor them for a further two years to assist them integrate into the workplace and have a successful career in the hospitality and tourism industries.\"\n\nI go to Burma regularly to visit family and whenever we visit Bagan we like to go to Sanon. The staff and service are friendly and excellent, and the food is divine. More \"fancy\" and higher prices than you would get at a normal restaurant, but the overhead isn't just paying for the restaurant operations but also for the students' cost of living, which includes a small stipend, formal classes, and even things like field trips. \n\nHere's their website. https://www.sanon-restaurant.org/\n\nIf you want to support their mission and can't or won't visit, you can donate via their website.  It cost about $1300 USD to sponsor one student for a year last I checked in about 2016, but of course donations of any amount are sure to be appreciated. Their FB page is updated regularly with school and restaurant news.\n\nI don't work for them, just a fan of their mission.  ",
      "How low was the cost? Lodging and food?",
      "I went to Bagan last year- stunning place, and I enjoyed that there is a lot of it that\u2019s not particularly touristy. Some incredible food there too!"

Anyone could go to the tub and fill up a separate bag with the raw chicken pieces. It was so unsanitary and in the US we would NEVER haha. I loved Thailand for that reason though - they cared so little about so many things people in the US freak out over.

Or Ramune drink, very casually in the grocery store.\nIn my country (Slovakia) I wouldn't be able to find this easily at all. There are Asian stores and some candy stores that sell international candy but it's really expensive. For example a single pack of Pop tarts - 4\u20ac. While in the US you can buy like pack of 16 for that price. I was also surprised to find \"European bread\", or here in Slovakia anything labeled \"American\" is kinda funny.

I know as a kid, first time in the US, I was surprised by the intricate cakes you could get at the supermarket. Now I know it's just sponge, cream and food colouring. But you don't buy a whole birthday cake in the supermarket here. But it's mostly the sizes of everything. The thought of having an open container with a gallon of milk in the fridge is weird. Like...who can drink all that milk before it spoils? Who has a fridge big enough? (Americans...duh)\n\nBut I remember being surprised about pharmacy products much more than about food. I once needed nail scissors and they were hard to come by. Only clippers. American tampons are weird, but I found German ones in Palm Springs yay! And the prices for face cream, tooth paste or shower gel is absurd. I'll tell y'all: If you're in Germany go to DM or Rossmann (DM is preferred though) and be amazed!

No Microwave, No normal food, I could only cook eggs and noodles and leave the rest to the experts :) Funny because over in Bali there are all these places that sell food on the street.

    "selftext": "I\u2019ll preface this by saying that my grandmother was born and raised in T\u00fcrkiye (diplomats). She loved the country, spoke Turkish, and returned nearly every year. She took me there about 20 years ago and as a 12 year old, I really loved it. \n\nFast forward these past two decades and I\u2019m so excited to take my spouse there. I am now sitting at IST feeling completely the opposite. Here is just a small section of why I felt so scammed by nearly the entire experience in only 3 days:\n\n- The airport approved taxi with fixed price tried to rip us off for 3x the fixed price into Istanbul. He locked the doors when I refused to pay the inflated price and threatened to call the police. I managed to get the locked door open and leave the agreed upon payment on the seat. \n\n- We had the \u201ctourist price\u201d menus constantly given to us with massive price gouging. Then when a Turkish friend joined us for dinner, we found out what was happening. Not to mention the constant yelling and cajoling of street scammers trying to get their next victim. \n\n- My spouse fell for the common shoe shine scam. This is my fault for not warning her so shame on me. She is also the nicest person I know so it feels even worse. But this guy actually ended up reaching into her bag and grabbing her wallet and removing 20\u20ac (all that was in it thankfully) before running off. So aggressive. \n\n- I wanted to take a photo of the building where my great-grandfather worked. It used to be an embassy, but is now a social club. I was angrily screamed at and told to leave despite being on a public sidewalk. I tried to explain why I wanted a photo using Google translate and the \u201csecurity man\u201d only screamed more and threatened to call the cops unless I paid him. I just ended up walking away and into the hotel across the street. \n- We just wanted to buy some Turkish delight to take home to my spouse\u2019s mother. The shop owner charged us 4x what was told to us it would be when he wrapped it up. He threatened to call the cops if we didn\u2019t pay, so we did, and now I am contesting the charge with the credit card company. We are two women in a foreign country so it\u2019s not like we are going to keep arguing with some random man we don\u2019t know.\n\n- Our hotel demanded we pay half our room in cash and were pressuring us at check out to write a \u201cfive star\u201d review online while standing there. Constant two-faced behaviour, especially when the wifi stopped working and the lift went out. \n\n- Finally, let\u2019s just even look at this airport. The view that every foreigner is a piggy bank continues. 22\u20ac for a f***ing burger at Burger King even at an inflated airport price is insane. There are not that many places to fill up water bottles either, so I suppose it\u2019s 10\u20ac for a bottle or just dehydrate yourself! Oh, and want internet? You only get it for an hour and you have to go get a special password! World\u2019s best airport? Maybe world\u2019s best scam airport. \n\nI\u2019ve lived in multiple Global South countries and never have I been so eager to leave a place, even where less developed than T\u00fcrkiye so this is not some \u201cwestern tourist\u201d issue. T\u00fcrkiye really has an issue on its hands and it is very lucky it has such beautiful and significant historical and religious sites to encourage people to come. It seemed every time we left our hotel we were barraged with scammers viewing two Dutch blonde women as being rich. One of us is a school teacher and the other works in international development so we are not flush with cash. From start to finish, I felt extremely sad and guilty for feeling so upset and angry since this was my grandmother\u2019s favourite place. I pride myself in being culturally respectful and sensitive, but even trying to take a step back and looking at it all from their perspective didn\u2019t help. I would never dream of scamming anyone out of money while also pretending to be kind. Another box of worms: these guys scam, never face any consequences, but me, the gay person, has to pretend not to be while I\u2019m in the country to be respectful of the homophobic culture and protect myself from being the victim of discrimination and crime. Makes total sense. \n\nFor a country that wants so badly to be part of the European community, shame on it for supporting and tolerating this culture of scam. I\u2019ve travelled plenty throughout countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, etc. also wanting to be in the European Union and never once felt like every move was vulnerable to being scammed. \n\nI have many Turkish friends in the Netherlands and now fully understand why they wouldn\u2019t want to live in T\u00fcrkiye. I understand this population of scammers represents a small portion of Turkish people and most people are good, but the country needs to stop allowing this sort of culture. Tons of police officers stand around doing nothing. There\u2019s almost no way to report this sort of thing to be taken seriously. These men are allowed to yell from their shops and overcharge \u201cidiot\u201d foreigners. \n\nI really supported the country before this, but now I will never come back to this country that my grandmother loved so dearly. I really am heartbroken. \n",

      "I went to Cappadocia last year and had a great time. \n\nEveryone was friendly, restaurant proppers and store people didn't feel overly aggressive. Food was great and cheap, often we'd get like a free entree or desert, definitely didn't notice any trickery with different pricing.\n\nWe went to a clothing store because she wanted to get a nice dress for taking pictures, I ended up talking to a guy across from me. Turned out he was the owner of the hotel we were staying at. His niece was from my country. We even talked politics randomly! I am usually quite reserved on political topics in countries where I know it can be sensitive but he brought up the topic through talking about how things are changing in T\u00fcrkiye. I mostly listened but hearing his views. He was actually quite critical of Erdogan yet still very proud to be Turkish. Told me to go to several stores and what prices to accept so as not to get scammed. Our hotel was having a rooftop party the night before we left and when he saw us he instantly asked if we wanted a drink, we got free shots and cocktails.\n\nIt was the first time going to the country. We left feeling like T\u00fcrkiye was a country with amazing hospitality. Almost seems like you experienced the polar opposite.",
      "Ma man why everyone threatened to call cops on you? I would've simply told them , yeah , call them or take the bloody money we agreed! I just don't get it! Been to Turkey many times , had an amazing time everywhere and everytime ! Maybe is different person to person ! Other thing is I always eat where locals eat , no matter where I travel in this\u00a0world, food tastier than tourist traps and they can't inflate the prices! All the best !",
      "I was there in April. I absolutely loved it. I was aware of all the common scams before I went. If something was too expensive I walked away. I checked menus before I ate and used public transport to get around. I pre booked private transfers from the airport, \u20ac30 each way, way cheaper than what a taxi journey of that time and distance would cost in my country and these weren't just normal cars, they were luxury Mercedes minivans. I certainly wouldn't have been intimidated into handing over money by some pushy salesman or taxi driver. I found it to be incredibly cheap compared to the western European country I come from. I knew about the prices at IST before travelling so ate a big breakfast and brought snacks from outside the airport. I stayed in kadikoy on the Asian side and I was so glad, not many tourists so the prices of food and drinks were much more reasonable. I spent less than half the money that I brought with me for the trip. I'm thinking about going back in October.",
      "I'm sorry you had this bad experience. I visited Turkey a few years ago from America and honestly I loved it, never got screwed over, was able to download a taxi app similar to Uber and was able to get around without knowing the language. People were really friendly, always offering apple tea even if I stopped in a shop to look at some clothing. People were very helpful in general. And the food and sweets were heavenly. I was really impressed by the Turks and their country.",
      "I feel for you. I spent two months in T\u00fcrkiye earlier this year and was pretty disappointed as well. The food was average and overpriced. The people were not all that friendly relative to other places I\u2019ve been. It felt like a constant scam. \n\nIstanbul was definitely my least favorite part of the country. Some of the sites were jaw dropping and the views from different parts of the Bosporus were incredible, but the shitty shitty culture and people just ruined it all. It takes you out of the immersive travel feeling you get when you\u2019re constantly being sold shit or up-charged for no reason.  \n\nTo put this in context I had just come from a month in Morocco. I had read horror stories of the tours and scams but ended up having a wonderful time in every part of the country I visited.",
      "We visited Istanbul this summer and left with a similar feeling. There is so much history and culture and food but the biggest impression was that everyone was trying to get the most money out of us as possible. Prices were insane, people constantly lied about costs, salesmen were very aggressive and would follow you down the street. Why does everyone think I need rugs? I can only imagine what it would be like as unaccompanied women.\n\nAlso I saw multiple women with children digging food from trash cans while it cost $30 per head to walk through an old mosque on the same street. That didn\u2019t sit well with me. I know everywhere has poverty but the juxtaposition was shocking.",
      "I traveled Egypt with my partner twenty years ago., backpacking duo. I won\u2019t ever go back. My experience was much the same. It\u2019s definitely one of those countries where group planning and organization is safer and insulates you better from the tourism scams. Every single thing we did, transit, sleeping, food, on and on, was a fight to get out of the obvious scam. I hated it.",
      "Back in the day turkey was amazing. Cheap accommodations, cheap food, etc. \n\nHowever that thing called inflation is probably what kicked off the turkey we know today.",
      "Turkey, especially Istanbul is one of the worst value and miserable travel experiences I've had. I travelled there 8 years ago and last year and the difference is night and day. It has some of the most stunning architecture and culture within Europe, yet is attached to an inflation ridden and desperate country that has turned to tourists as a source of gullible and bottomless cash pit \n\nNot to say Turkey was ever great, the bazaar rip offs have always been there, but are turned to 11 now and I don't think I ever met one honest store open in the bazaar there last year (maybe half were honest eight years ago). The prices are legitimately insane and way more than Western Europe, the ticket prices for entry are bonkers even for the smallest thing and the famed hamams are eye gouging prices.\n\nEven if you are a rich tourist in Istanbul and somehow willing to pay for whatever misguided reason, that just opens you to be a cash pinata. I partly blame Middle East and American tourists who just sign blank cheques for things, I had to intervene with one elderly couple what was trying to pay the lira price in dollars to the very willing acceptance of the shopkeeper and was physically removed from the store. At the very least the elderly couple left without paying and thanked me, but Istanbul seems to attract some of the most naive travellers, when it requires a battle hardened cynic to survive.\n\nOutside the tourist traps, the food is still expensive but less price gouging and honestly some of the better food I've eaten. In the tourist traps, it's crap. And most of the centre is the tourist trap as it's the city that is the tourist appeal, so that's a big problem for the average tourist. \n\nIf you want a developing country experience for developed country+ prices, go to Turkey. If you want the Istanbul feel for cheaper, but including cons, go to Morocco. If you want the Istanbul experience, but low prices and friendly people, go to Uzbekistan or the Balkans. If you want an easy trip for older travellers, stick to Western and Central Europe.\n\nDon't go to Istanbul.",
      "I feel you, loved the natural areas of the country and sights in Istanbul... but being spoken to/followed aggressively by vendors on the streets, the behaviour of the taxi drivers and being overcharged for bland food just soured the experience.",
      "I went to Istanbul last month, almost the opposite experience. The exception was taxi drivers who are complete scammers, and Turkish delight sellers at the Grand Bazaar. Some sellers at the Grand Bazaar were polite, slick, con artists. But every country has their douche bags, Turkiye certainly does not have a monopoly on terrible people.\n\n**edit**\n\nAnother thing, I usually fly United and their food is dog crap now, even in Polaris. Turkish airlines had the most fantastic airline food I have had in a great many years. And the Turkish airlines lounge at Istanbul airport is goddamn amazing.",
      "Take the metro or bus next time. Only rich or inexperienced travelers take a taxi.\n\nStay out of tourist areas in all countries you go to.\n\nGo to local restaurants where they don\u2019t even speak English. Best food and extremely cheap.\n\nBuy Turkish delight for a few cents (!) in a regular grocery store. Not in a tourist area.\n\nNever buy food in an airport.\nI don\u2019t know about Turkish security, but in many countries you can bring your own sandwiches as long as they are free of too much sauce.\u00a0\n\nAlso it\u2019s better to go during low season if possible.\u00a0\n\nDo this and you\u2019ll have an amazing time in Turkey.\u00a0",
      "Sorry you had such a bad experience! \n\nWere you only in Istanbul, though? Keep in mind that city is particularly known for scams... Especially in the most touristy areas. It's night and day difference when you go into the neighborhoods where locals live or other cities, especially the small ones (at least in my experience). Different prices for locals vs tourists is very common in touristy places... Same in Thailand etc too. Usually doesn't happen in the local areas though. \n\nMy experience was opposite to yours... I had one scam happen (my first Airbnb did not exist), but that was it. Somehow I never encountered any of the other scams. I'm also female, but traveled (mostly) solo both times I was in Turkey. I did a whole road trip the first time, visiting Istanbul first (without a car) and then picking up a car in Izmir and driving from Izmir to Fethiye (for a friend's wedding)... visiting coastal cities on my way back up. So many really nice places! I was treated very well by everyone. \n\nMaybe it helped that in bigger cities, I took public transit everywhere or walked (only one cab, and he didn't overcharge). Maybe it helped that I am from an area that also scams and was traveling alone, so I might've walked/talked/acted differently. I dress like mainstream locals. Anytime shop keepers etc approached me, I insist they leave me alone (or ignore them, if possible). I try to find hotels and restaurants where local families would go, not where Western tourists frequent. I ask locals for recommendations about where to eat (not hotel staff though btw). This has helped me in many cities. I didn't have any problem with cabs or shops overcharging, and I was just there last year for the second time. (Second time was for work, actually). \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nMaybe it's also the time of year? Did you go in summer -- height of tourist season & when it's way too hot? I think it makes a huge difference to go off-season (May, in my case). \n\nThe airport is relatively expensive, but so are all airports. There's this one area where you can get plates of local food, and tbh it was fairly priced considering it's an airport. Inflation is very high right now in Turkey... So what used to be much cheaper is now not so cheap. My Turkish friends (visiting their families regularly) have complained about this huge increase in prices -- it's a real economic problem, getting significantly worse over the last 10 years. \n\nAnyway I hope you go back sometime but visit other places in Turkey. Just visiting Istanbul is like only seeing NYC in the US. There's totally different places awaiting your visit!",
      "Just came back from a trip to southern Turkiye  (dalaman area) and had an amazing time. Locals were beyond friendly, food was amazing, everything felt safe and I cannot wait to go back and explore more of this amazing country. \n\nAt the same time, I can attest to the fact that all touristy areas of Istanbul are a bit sketchy, and can take advantage of tourists, I never had any problems there except the crappy cheap hotel reeking of cigarette smoke and no running A/C. Also Istanbul airport is insanely expensive, but there are workarounds to that (bring dried food and fill up your water bottle at the many water fountains)\n\n  \nJust felt I had to put this here as it feels a bit unfair towards the country.",
      "My experience was just the same! I was a solo female traveller who got there to get surgery, so I was visibly wounded and fighting back would have been a terrible idea. I was scammed by restaurants, taxi drivers and food vendors and couldn't say a word about it if I wanted to stay safe. I'm glad I took some time to visit Istanbul, so I won't have to set food there ever again.",
      "Not much comparison because I was only in the aiport for an hour, but...\n\nIST Airport was a fucking nightmare yesterday.  For some reason they put up LAST CALL for boarding like a solid 1hr before take off causing me to fucking PANIC run from my arrival gate, through customs and to the new gate which was a solid 2 mile run.  I was DRENCHED in sweat when I finally got to my gate just for the line to be full.\n\nThey also oversold the plane and were only offering 600 euro to take a flight the next day.\n\nI will say though, the food on the Turkish Airlines flight in Economy was actually pretty fucking good.  I even got breakfast on my 2 hour flight with fresh bread.  \n\nCompared to Condor, which 90% of it wasnt edible at all, it was a nice change.  But not worth the extra 4 hours of travel time thats for sure."

    "selftext": "Booked a three day jungle trip from Iquitos, Peru. Within the first few hours, thanks to the extremely negligent (bordering on the reckless) decisions of the company and guide (edit: see company name below), we were completely lost deep in the Amazon jungle with no food, water or any safety supplies. Guide had collapsed from exhaustion and lay down to die, refusing to get up. Rescue was nothing short of a miracle. Full story is below - Any thoughts on how to make the company take some sort of responsibility are appreciated.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother (21M) and I (27F) have always wanted to do a trip into the jungle, so planned an entire itinerary in Peru around doing so. We looked at a few different online tours, and booked a two-night tour leaving from Iquitos and going into the Amazon. The tour was one of the less luxurious options but had very good reviews so we felt it was a safe choice. We spent the days leading up to it in Lima procuring and stocking our day packs with safety supplies (correct clothing and gear, strong insect repellent, flashlights, medicines) and researching how to be safe. We were worried about lethal snake or spider bites, jaguars, caimans, mosquito-borne diseases etc, but the golden rule from all of the advice online was to always trust and follow your guide and you\u2019ll be safe, as they know the jungle and will always cut a safe path for you and point out dangers. Thousands of people do Amazon tours every year and have a great time. We were really excited.\n\nOn the day the trip was starting, we met at the office in Iquitos and then took a boat for about an hour and a half down the Amazon river. The small group doing our tour included our guide (Peruvian \\~35M but seemed to speak good English), a young girl who seemed to serve no purpose except to accompany him, and a mother and daughter (\\~55F and 30F), the latter of which spoke fluent English and Spanish.\n\nThe boat made a couple of five minute stops along the way, firstly to get some gas and then to let some other guests off. It stopped a third time at about 11am and our guide motioned for us to get off. We thought we must be starting the tour so picked up our bags, but he told us to leave our bags on the boat. We assumed this was just another five minute stop. We asked if we needed our gumboots, and he said no.\n\nWe follow him off the boat. When we get up the river bank, he looks at our empty hands and asks \u201cdo you not have any water?\u201d We were extremely confused as he had told us to leave our things on the boat and hadn\u2019t explained what we were doing. He says \u201cdon\u2019t worry, we are just doing a short 20-minute walk down the the track to a local village so you'll be fine.\u201d The guide didn't have any water either. My brother and I are a bit concerned, but by the time we turn around the boat has already left with our stuff (including our water, carefully chosen repellent etc), so we trust that we only have a short period of walking and we follow the guide down the track into the jungle.\n\nThe first 20 minutes are lovely and the guide is exemplary of what we had read online, pointing out interesting insects and telling us which ones to avoid, and showing us the safe places to step. At some point though, he leads us off the track and into the deep jungle. I\u2019m completely unconcerned and assuming this is all part of the plan. He tells us later that this is because he came across a large fallen tree over the track and we had to go around it.\n\nThings start to go a bit awry from here. We walk through the deep jungle for an hour or so, and our guide is becoming less responsible. He\u2019s charging ahead and leaving us to cut our own path (he doesn\u2019t have a machete or delicate instructions of where to step like the guides we read about online). We have to clamber over trunks, under vines, avoid vicious ants, and get stuck in mud. Luckily we didn\u2019t encounter anything more deadly; god knows it was definitely lurking. The mother who was with us fell over a few times and the guide didn't seem to care.\n\nEventually we make it to a small clearing and are starting to get a bit fed up, given we are yet to reach the village and are getting hungry, thirsty, sweaty, muddy and bitten. But, we are relieved to be out of the thick forest. The clearing has a basic bamboo shelter, and a little stream with two small aluminium boats. Is this the village? Our guide tells us to wait here and disappears for another half an hour without communicating anything to us, which is extremely irritating. He eventually returns and explains that we have to go back as \u201cthe boat that was meant to pick us up isn\u2019t there\u201d, which doesn\u2019t make any sense as we thought we were heading to a village. He says it will be 20 minutes maximum to get back to the river and, to our relief, starts leading us along a small dirt track. At this point (probably around 2pm) we just want to get back ASAP - we\u2019re hungry and thirsty. To our dismay, he shortly leads us off the track again back into the jungle, pointing at the sun and saying that he can tell which direction the river is in. Although annoyed that we have to wade through mud again, I still at this point have no suspicion that we are lost, and trust that he knows exactly where he\u2019s taking us. My brother isn\u2019t so sure, and says to us \u201cif he\u2019s using the sun as navigation I\u2019m not that confident about this\u201d. The rest of us laugh and follow our guide as all of the online advice told us to do. Stick with the guide, you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nWe stumble our way through the deep jungle without any assistance. By now, the guide is charging so far ahead that we can barely see him and have to keep yelling out to him. We are being bitten by red ants which is very painful, falling over and wading through mud, where we could hear running water bubbling underneath us. At one point, I fell thigh-deep into a muddy swamp and screamed, half expecting a caiman to bite my legs off (our gumboots would have come in handy if we hadn't been told leave them behind). The guide did not seem to care. At this point we scream to him to slow the fuck down and wait for us because this is extremely dangerous. He eventually does and stops to talk to us, saying that we should wait here (in the middle of nowhere) and his colleague will bring us food and water. Again, we are confused. He then leaves again into the jungle before we can stop him. We are in disbelief.  We look around and there is dense forest/swamp in all directions and we are being constantly bitten by mosquitos. We don't want to wait here for long, especially without water and repellent.\n\nHe returns a few minutes later looking extremely exhausted, having taken off his shirt, and collapses onto the forest floor. Between desperate gasps for breath, he finally drops the act and admits he has no idea where we are. We are completely lost.\n\nIt soon becomes clear that we have been lost for hours. We figure the guide was charging ahead to try and find a familiar path and completely exhausted himself doing so. He has collapsed shirtless on a muddy log, with loads of insects biting him. He is too exhausted to care. He is delirious and completely incoherent, seemingly forgetting how to speak English except to ask for water (which we didn\u2019t have) - luckily the daughter in our group could translate for us, because he managed to get a bit of phone reception and called his boss. We learned from her that he could not explain to his boss where on earth we were. He was even trying to describe the clearing with the two boats (which the boss did not recognise), showing that we were already lost all the way back then, and he had tried to hide it from us all that time. He had nothing with him to prepare for this situation: no flare, no water, no machete, no GPS, not even a compass.\n\nWe spend the next hour or so trying to think logically about how to survive. We got the guide\u2019s phone password and contacts as it seemed that we were going to lose him at any minute. Although I didn\u2019t have reception, my google map had partially loaded so that we could perhaps see the direction of the river and hack through the jungle to make our way to it and hopefully flag someone down. I was nervous about doing this because (1) it meant leaving the guide (who kept insisting he couldn't stand), leaving us without his knowledge of the jungle but also leaving him to die; (2) I really doubted whether the map was correct and (3) it would mean hours navigating the thick jungle by ourselves, risking encountering deadly animals, dangerous tribes, anything. And, we probably only had an hour of sunlight left...\n\nWe were all extremely thirsty and were trying not to panic, but things were not looking good. It was extremely hot and muddy, mosquitoes were flying everywhere, and we were on constant alert for snakes, spiders, jaguars etc. Everyone remained extremely calm and thought logically which was a blessing (the mother and I shared a hug; I think she suspected I was about to get upset), and we were so lucky to have the other two in our group, but it was looking like we were going to have to try and survive the night (or longer) in the Amazon jungle without water, without a guide, and without any of our supplies.\n\nThe daughter then manages to get a bit of reception on her phone and can speak directly to the boss herself, although we still have no way of describing our whereabouts. We send him a screenshot of my half-loaded map image. She contacts her boyfriend and tells him that she will likely die in the jungle and that she loves him, but can he please contact the authorities asap. We ask our guide what the emergency number in Peru is and he brazenly refuses to tell us (I guess because he was worried about getting in trouble). So does his pointless girlfriend.\n\nWe discuss our options, including the risk of leaving the guide behind, as he is still refusing to move or offer any advice despite our pleas. We eventually decide that, because the sun is going down and because of the risks associated with trying to get to the river, we are safer trying to go back the way we came and at least find the dirt track, which is safer from nature than the deep jungle and which also has a better chance of someone coming along the track and finding us. My brother is confident that he can remember the way back (I\u2019m not). The guide, realising that we are about to leave him here on his own, gets a new lease of life and we are able to heave him to his feet. He stumbles ahead behind my brother, and I\u2019m at the back with the other three girls. We are all trying not to break down.\n\nEventually, dozens of ant stings later, we hear a faint motor engine in the distance. We start screaming for help at the top of our lungs. To our dismay, it sounds like it has gone past without hearing us, but then we hear the noise stop. We keep screaming for our lives until, a few minutes later, we hear voices coming towards us through the jungle. We start crying with relief. Six villagers reach us, drag us back through the jungle, and load us onto a tray on the back of a motorbike, with water and biscuits. We learn that they are from one of the jungle villages who were contacted to go out looking for us, which is why they were on the track.\n\nI think by now it\u2019s about 4pm. The guide has  attempts to explain what happened, stating that he has over a decade of experience in the jungle and this has never happened before. We tell him that we just want to go home. He starts off saying it\u2019s not possible to get back to Iquitos tonight and that we will need to stay at the jungle lodge with him, but we won\u2019t take no for an answer. We don\u2019t trust him one bit with our safety. He eventually agrees to arrange for a boat to take us back.\n\nWe ride on the back of the motorbike for about half an hour, over bumpy terrain and occasionally getting stuck in the mud (it seems like this track hasn't been used in a long time). We are still being bitten by ants - my brother has hundreds stuck in his trousers. But we are all so thankful to be alive.\n\nOn our journey back, we learn that my map image was completely wrong and that it seemed to be a snapshot of my last downloaded location many hours ago. We also learn that the villagers on the bike didn\u2019t hear our screams over the motor - one of them happened to fall off at the exact right time, so they stopped the bike to let him back on and that\u2019s when they heard us.\n\nFrom speaking to locals and looking online, it seems like this is the first time a guided tour from Iquitos has got lost in the Amazon.\n\nWe eventually got back to the office expecting apologies and compensation. Obviously, the money is not important at all when compared to our survival. But, to our huge surprise, the boss said we couldn\u2019t get our money back because \u201cit\u2019s already been spent on the lodge\u201d. We argued and argued and he eventually agreed to give us some in cash back now and another portion later to our bank account, but we won\u2019t see that in our account for a couple of weeks and even then it would only be a bit over half what we paid. He basically called our bluff on bringing them to justice. He only gave the other two about half of theirs back as well. We ended up giving up as he was being pretty menacing and we felt unsafe, and just wanted to get the next flight out of there.\n\nOf course we plan to write a bad review for the company but we want to see the money first, although might cut our losses on that. We just feel like it\u2019s perverse that we were left to die in the jungle in extremely dangerous circumstances and it was completely the fault of the company that we put our trust in. They were severely negligent sending us with an incompetent guide without any supplies for the worst case scenario (which is what eventuated). It was an absolute death trap. We are still very shaken by the whole experience (this happened 4 days ago). And are also sad to have not had the adventure we dreamed about for ages.\n\nAlthough we were still a few hours or days off dying of thirst, the scary part was the prospect of having to survive the night, or longer, in the jungle alongside all the horrors of the Amazon and still being no closer to being found.\n\nOne of our group videoed the entire thing. We are hoping to get the footage from her and can post the link once we do.\n\nAny thoughts on what we can do are welcome. Thanks for reading!\n\nEDIT:\n\nName of tour company: Canopy Tours Iquitos\n\nItinerary and trip we booked was called Iquitos: Amazon Expedition 3 days, can find the itinerary on Get Your Guide, seems to not let me post with the link but should come up with a google and had good reviews on there.\n\nEDIT 2: we booked directly through the company\u2019s website after finding itinerary and reviews on GYG, their website can be found online too",

      "I travel for novelty and new experiences. Food is one of the most accessible ways to get to know the culture of a new country and give you a deeper insight into its locals. The sharing of food (even with strangers) is an integral part of many cultures - my most memorable travel experiences have often been when locals have invited me in for a cuppa or to share a meal with their family. \n\nOne of my favourite things to do in a new location is a guided food tour. Having a condensed sampling of key dishes with a local sharing the significance of particular dishes is invaluable. And sets you up for the rest of the trip to understand what you\u2019re eating and in turn, be bolder with your food choices.",
      "Not the main reason, but a very close second. Part of my travel planning includes checking out the local dishes, and what restaurants are around. When I went to Singapore and Malaysia, I had a whole list of foods and places I wanted to try, and may or may not have planned some of my sightseeing in Singapore around specific Hawker stalls ;)",
      "Not for me at all. I have celiac disease, which means that I react to wheat and flour, and even the hint of wheat and flour, the way most people react to raw seafood. Food is actually the worst part of traveling for me. I got a vegetable omelette in Hawaii earlier this year and spent the rest of the day in the bathroom. If I could just stop eating entirely when I'm away from home, it would make my life so much earlier.        \n\nBut! If I could eat like a regular person, I'm sure I'd be super into it. So many places have   such distinct food styles that I'd love to try.",
      "food. wine, whiskey.  they are all highly regional, so you travel to a region, and learn the good ones there.\n\nwhen you are not eating or drinking, you wander around seeing other stuff",
      "Yes, 100 plus countries all for the main purpose of food and exploring culinary customs.\n\nCountries lacking a rich food culture have been significantly less interesting to me. Natural beauty is large draw too.",
      "I don't get how someone can say they travel for culture then ignore food. Like that's not a center part of culture.",
      "I look for street food while traveling for great food and culture.",

      "Food and hiking!",
      "I definitely focus my tourism on food and drink. Don't care about museums or monuments, give me the grimiest street food and let me collect some Michelin stars.\n\nThat or I'm laying on a beach and never leaving my resort.",
      "Honestly, no. I travel for the feeling of adventure. Food would be near the bottom of my list.\n\nI expect to trigger some people with this but I enjoy sushi and I never even tried it when I was in Tokyo. I just forgot. I was going from museum to cultural site to gallery and occasionally stopping off in bars along the way. I\u2019d drop into 7-Eleven and grab a sandwich or some noodles if I was hungry.",
      "No. I admire foodies, and their dedication to it, and I will always try local cuisine just to kinda check the box, but at the end of the day I want the sights and to interact with the people and to try and immerse myself in things I don't know (which often comes with food to be fair, but it's not the point for me). I will say I have fond memories of napoli pizza and Japanese ramen and so on, but it's not something I think about at all when I'm making my plans to go to a place.",
      "Eating local food/ fruit makes some of the best memories on travel. Whether it be drinking watermelon juice on the streets of Yangon, or eating a $1 thali with the locals in Delhi , there are great moments to be experienced.",
      "It's one of the many main reasons for me. To me, a great destination has to have great food. Getting excited about and researching restaurants just adds another layer to a great trip with great memories.",
      "Main reason for me is \u201cseeing the world\u201d, but once I get there it\u2019s all about food first, art/architecture/history next. \n\nFood tells the stories of places you\u2019ve never been and sharing food with people in a new place is the best way to get to know that place. \n\nAnthony Bourdain is my spirit animal",

I\u2019m not talking just clubs and sweaty dancing, but also to meet locals at bars and clubs and cafes and just get to see and learn about and from people who are different than me and everyone I grew up with (as in culturally). I\u2019ve made some amazing friends, some lifelong, some for the trip, and some just for a night (if you know what I mean) but man. It gives me so much life meeting so many awesome and incredible people and hear their stories. I\u2019m told being the stereotypical gregarious American helps, but yeah. Also, the food ! \ud83d\ude02",
      "I\u2019d say I book 75% of my travel based on the cuisine or food I\u2019d like to try. Vietnam was booked for the food and the beautiful country was just icing on the cake. But I\u2019m currently in the Serengeti and I\u2019m not here for the food. Lol. Although Zanzibar has the greatest soup I\u2019ve ever eaten, which was a surprise. If you ever have the chance, try Zanzibar mix (urojo).",
      "Precisely. I love culture though as well. And an instrumental part of culture is food. Especially in countries that are perceived as less fortunate. They pour their hearts out into their food.",
      "Food and beauty. \n\nIn the States, we have a wide variety of foreign foods available (depending on where you live), and that's awesome. However, experiencing those foods in their native countries is on a completely different level. The flavors are richer and there is no added \"bs.\" Some little food places have a rich history since they've been around 50+ or 100+ years and I love that so much.",
      "Yes, food and relaxation.  The best vacation I\u2019ve ever been on was a farm in NZ where the food all came from the property and other local farms. Sheep milk labneh is what I dream about",
      "Hands down that\u2019s a huge part of travelling for me. I want to try all their food. I also have a thing that I try to go to a McDonald\u2019s because every country has differences and I like to see what they are",
      "I like meeting different people. We had a great evening with scottish, german and canadian couples on a walking food (and booze) tour in Sorrento Italy recently. The tour was great. The people were better. \n\nSeeing natural sites and old buildings also fun. Walking 7 miles a day-less fun, but makes for some great stories.",

      "Somehow yes. A friend pointed me that my motivation to travel was food. At that time I wouldn't considered like that. However I did a lot of research on what to eat and what to see as a local so I can enrich my experience. \n\nAs a mexican, good food is almost a given locally. I'm not going to ask for tacos or such in middle east or Asia, but I had amazing meals in France, Hawaii, Israel and Korea.\n\nAll by throwing expectations by the window.... and it did pay off.\n\n\nNow days I do travel mostly to visit friends.... while having good meals with them... so... maybe my motivation is In the middle?",

      "See places - it\u2019s not the same when yout see pictures or videos\n\nMeet people - every place has kind people and not so kind ones \n\nEat food - what they would eat normally, the same food made in restaurants in other countries can get close but not the same.",

For example, in El Salvador they put hot sauce on their chips. I started doing that and It was good Or in South Africa where they put fries on the gatsby burger",
      "Yes! I like to immerse myself in different cultures and try or see new things but good food is paramount above and beyond what can make or break a place for me. \n\nFood tours is a good tip I picked up on this thread but I enjoy visiting the local markets (where they sell mostly raw ingredients) because it gives me a chance to interact with real locals and you find so many unfamiliar things! It\u2019s just a very informative experience overall.",
      "I lived in Chicago for 25 years and grew to loathe it.  I have to go back for a wedding soon.  I dread going except for the fact that I\u2019ll be able to get  some of my favorite foods such as Italian beef, Hot Dogs \ud83c\udf2d,  pizza \ud83c\udf55, etc so I get what you mean.",
      "Food it a big part of it.   In general, the reasons I travel are a bit elusive.  I think the main reason is the feeling of being in a different place.  It's exotic, novel, exciting, full of possibilities.   Being in a different world gives me the sense that I can be a different person.",
      "I make a point to look up a popular dish in each place I travel to, and find a restaurant that specializes in that dish. \n\n* Porcheddu (slow roasted baby pig) in Sardinia\n\n* Pig Knuckle in South Tyrol\n\n* Camel in Marrakech, Morocco \n\n* Bled Cake in Lake Bled, Slovenia\n\n* Waffles and beer in Belgium\n\n* Lemoncello in Capri, Italy\n\nWhile food isn't the primary reason why I travel, it's an area that accentuates each trip. I can't imagine living off McDonalds and grocery store food for the entire trip (although I've eaten plenty of each while traveling). Choosing at least one night out at a nice local restaurant is a great way to experience a new city.\n\nNext month I'm going to Malta and I'm looking forward to trying their dishes with rabbit.",
      "Vegan here! While I don't travel for food, I make sure to have some vegan places ready to go in the area I will be visiting, read about what local dishes are accidentally vegan, and try to find vegan versions of local dishes to enjoy myself and better understand their culture.\nI also always eat at small places and restaurants, I prefer to give my money to family-business rather than chains or alike.\nI also love visiting the supermarkets, they tell a lot about people and their lifestyle. I'll grab some snacks to have handy if I'm hungry when hanging around but it's not time for a full meal yet. And I usually take snacks back home for friends and family.",
      "Coming from Chicago, I honestly find I am often not impressed with the food I find while travelling.  Sometimes I am glad to get home just to have a really good meal.  When I do travel somewhere with great cuisine, I rest easy knowing I will almost always be able to find a reasonable iteration back at home.  :)  Sometimes travel just lets me know what kind of food I ought to be looking for when I return.",
      "I traveled with my chef friend to Mexico for seafood. Best time ever!",

      "Reason why, no. A huge part of the experience, certainly.\n\nOften times it's not even the food that's the best part, it's where I'm eating the food at.\n\n\nPicnicking with Lemurs\n\nBBQing at our villa over the Indian Ocean\n\nSipping a Frappicino in a Macau casino at 11 P.M.\n\nMunching on strudel in Munich.\n\nBreathing the atmosphere of the New York Grill in Tokyo.\n\n\nAnd a ton more.",
      "We make YouTube videos, yeah they are based around the best food to eat, plus some fun things to do.  We just love trying new foods!",
      "Food is huge but I also love eco-tourism. After going to Switzerland, I did not enjoy the food   \nscene but it didn't stop me from enjoying how beautiful everything is. I will never understand when bus tours take their tourists to the non-local joints (like when Chinese tourists mostly go to Chinese restaurants when traveling).",
      "Yes! I\u2019m picky but I love ethnic food. I\u2019m dreaming of going to Japan because I just want some good authentic food. My city is very diverse but not that great",
      "It's definitely one of the reasons I travel - I choose places to visit based on how appealing the cuisines are to me. And I usually have a few must-visit restaurants on my list when I plan an itinerary, but only if they're conveniently located. I still prioritize sight-seeing, history, architecture, and natural beauty, and generally won't rework my schedule to visit a specific restaurant or street-food vendor that's out of the way.\n\nFood has been a highlight of many of my trips, though - whether it's a $10 spicy tako poke bowl at Foodland in Maui, the most decadent, delicately spun knafeh in downtown Amman, or succulent pork (with just the right amount of fat) at a tiny hole-in-the-wall BBQ joint in Itaewon, Seoul. And having fresh coconut water from a coconut cut open by a machete is seriously one of the simplest and greatest pleasures in life.",

      "No. I don't care about food at all. Some food is good, sure, but I mostly see meals as a waste of time and money.",
      "Meh. I think I've become so turned off by the glut of YT and streaming food & travel shows, where the hosts are drooling over everything, that my interest in food when traveling has actually waned rather than intensified. \n\nI still enjoy a good meal or treat, but I'm more about something that tastes fresh/local/fine rather than it having to be *amazing* or that it blows me away.",

      "No, but it is what happens *over food.* When you go to a truly local restaurant, especially one that isn\u2019t very high end, you see and meet people just living their lives and that\u2019s what travel is about. \n\nThough certain destinations are worth it just for the food. Oaxaca is amazing.",

      "Architecture / history / scenery / food.\n\nReally the atmosphere of another culture. Food is just an easy way to do it all at once",
      "Whilst experiencing the local food options are an enjoyable part, it\u2019s not the main reason or deciding factor on destination- I can either get them here or cook them myself. It\u2019s more about taking in the all the sights and sounds, experiencing the culture differences - and sometimes sitting on a beach or at a pool :)",
      "I travel for art, but food is a close second!",
      "nope, for me it's only a tiny part. sure, it's nice to eat local cuisine but i generally wanna stick to the cheaper options (cooking/streetfood/cheap restaurant) to make my trip last longer. in fact, i mainly go far nature and architecture, and cool activities (surfing, hiking, diving)",
      "Big part of it. It just so happens that my fave food is from great places.",
      "Certainly a huge part of it, but wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the sole reason. But in terms of just experiencing other places/cultures in general, food is likely at the top. Hope you keep getting to enjoy new cuisines!",
      "Not really. I mean, I do try to eat some local food when travelling, especially if they have very well known meals or if it sounds like something I'd like, but it's not my priority. I'm more into sights and walking around. Also trying to find a restaurant in my budget stresses me out, so I usually end up eating fast food or cold food from a supermarket.",
      "We are going to Naples soon for honeymoon. The reason is exactly food, it's home of the Neapolitan pizza of course, there is also Italian wine and pasta. Can't wait!",
      "I wouldn\u2019t say that food is the reason I travel, but I certainly plan around what and where I\u2019ll be eating while traveling.  I love the whole package (exploring new cities/towns, museums, natural wonders, architecture, hikes, snorkeling, history, etc.) but I always make sure I have a few options for where to eat while seeing all of that.",

Some of the more exotic locals (Bail, Vietnam, Thailand, Egypt, Morocco) I will probably never see because of it. I feel I am limited to Western Europe and even then it is concerning.",
      "No, I'd say the reason I travel is to experience new cultures and new ways of life. To expand my horizons and get out of my little bubble. The food and beautiful scenery is a perk, though!",
      "Im a super picky eater, and I hate vegetables. Not food for me, and Id have to bring a 2 week supply of beef jerky.\n\nI want to see history, adventure, and beautiful nature. Maybe converse with the locals while hoping I didn't pick the wrong one and get chopped up somewhere.",

It\u2019s always wild when I\u2019m backpacking around a country known for great food (other than Italy) and I run into people eating pizza every night. Like how is food not such a huge part of exploring a country for you?\n\nEven in countries with underwhelming local cuisine I try to eat as much as I can",
      "Depends, I'd visit Vietnam or Turkey for the food, but obviously I'm not gonna visit Iceland or Norway for the food; I'd rather visit them for the beauty and culture. Sometimes it's a mix of both, like NYC or Greece.",

      "No. I usually travel to get away or see sights I would never see. I've noticed that lots of places claim they're known for their food but it all tastes the same level. It's more about the Vibes and cultures that influence the enjoyment of food, not the food itself.",
      "No, it's pretty far down my list to be honest. Like, I'm happy to buy stuff from a grocery store for breakfast and lunch every day and do some dinners too. I'll make some effort to find local recipes that use ingredients that aren't as common back home, but nothing crazy. I mean...as long as you're not making butter pasta or something every night, I don't really see the issue with that. It's not like normal people are dropping $20+/night on restaurant food. Or maybe I just love paying less than 2 Euro for a kilogram of tabbouleh from a hypermarket too much?  Frankly, I've always found it strange how many peoples' vacation stories seem so focused on food. \n\nI know it's not the same, but I've lived in two of the most diverse cities in the US so it's not like I struggle to find different cuisines to try at home. \n\nThen again, some of my favorite trips have been backcountry ones where I eat dehydrated meals every meal for 10+ days.",

Obviously there is a lot of time to fill in between meals and I love to explore whatever makes a place unique or at least different from where I live. \n\nLast summer I went to Alaska, and while I had a great time, I will forever remember how mediocre and overpriced the food was (except the fish). \n\nOf course, Alaska is a place you don\u2019t really go for the food though, so it was less disappointing than if it had been somewhere else.",
      "No, I travel for adventure, photography and exploration, usually on a budget. Foodies who say you should spend loads on food annoy me as it\u2019s not my priority and often my diet is strict. I would rather visit twice the places on a shoestring than half the number with a load of expensive restaurants thrown in.",
      "I wish. I have a really complicated relationship with food\u2026 One could say I\u2019m a picky eater (I prefer \u201csensitive\u201d because picky connotes I have a choice about my preferences and am just being a brat). The foods that I like, I do enjoy eating. But there\u2019s not too too many foods on my safe list. And I have no control over what\u2019s to my taste or not (one thing I wish people would understand about most \u201cpicky eaters\u201d). I will say that I will try most foods. Most of the time when I try new foods I don\u2019t really like them but at least I try! So, when I travel, I will try maybe a few things but try to stick to my tried and true safe foods so that I can focus on enjoying the experience in its entirety rather than have anxiety around mealtime. I do love watching traveling/cooking shows and pretending I would love the foods they show :)",
      "Not at all. Food is usually just a bonus for me. But not once has that ever been a priority for me. Admittedly it might effect a long term visit though",
      "I mean, I love most of the other aspects of visiting a new place, but the highlight for me is the food. Makes me feel like I've gained insight into a different culture. I also love visiting mini-markets in other places and finding all the random snacks that are different.",
      "Exploring food culture in different countries is quite amazing! This is definitely one of the goals of my trips. More importantly, it's even more wonderful if you could learn how to cook some dishes and share with family and friends back home :)",

      "I completely disagree. Zagreb had got to be one of the most boring cities to visit as a tourist for anything longer than a day. Food isn't great in the city proper (there are some really good places but overall it's not the best), there's very little to do, museums are meh, art is almost non-existent... Just generally a poor choice for travel if you're looking for an international tourist destination with lots to do.   \n\nAnd before anyone down votes me, I did like the city and if you have an opportunity to go I'd recommend it, but plan to leave the city after two days at most and experience the absolutely fan-fucking-tastic country that is Croatia. What a wonderful country with an interesting history, great food, a blossoming international wine presence, some of the best fucking cheeses (looking at you, Pag), and some freaking fantastic and hospitable people. Truly a gem of a country.  \n\nThat said... Zagreb... 2 days tops...1 full day is plenty for most people.",

      "I don't think they are doing anything special, I suspect you have a more sensitive digestive system than most people.  I don't think it's usual to find that you get sick just trying new foods - most people who do experience illness abroad are generally picking up an actual infection from slightly unhygienic food, or eating something hugely out of their comfort zone (e.g. masses of chili or extremely high salt content, etc).\n\nThis sounds like something you should talk to your own doctor about.",
      "I always carry lactic acid bacteria pills that really help your stomach with different kinds of bacteria compared to what you're used to in foods abroad. Immunity building will help too, but that's for longer trips. But not everything is a perfect solution and won't save you 100% of the time, in Laos I literally thought I will die when I ate something I shouldn't have and was badly bedridden for four days (and I had travelled 1.5 months at that point). Still very few cases overall for me and I'd say I have a \"picky stomach\".",
      "You may just be much more sensitive to a certain ingredient than others. I know people who can eat anything, and some who are much less tolerant to certain foodstuffs, spices, herbs. Some people just have a 'stomach of steel'.\n\nIt may be worth getting some tests to see if you're intolerant or allergic to anything in case you're responding to something in particular.",
      "Hm...I think it comes with experience; your body can get used to variety. Or you specifically might be sensitive to some things. I have an easily upset stomach, but not by food variety, I know certain foods like legumes will upset it so I know to avoid them, but that never stopped me from eating everything from street food in Singapore to giant platters of home meals in Senegal",
      "It's not really your immunity at work here, but your gut microbiome. \n\nThe science behind how our gut microbiome is regualted is still fairly new so I can't really suggest anything but there's evidence that your gut microbiome during infancy and childhood impacts how \"flexible\" it is in adulthood. \n\nAdditionally, there's weak evidence that certain probiotic supplements, fermented foods, and other good sources of bacteria may help protect you from gastrointestinal distress when you eat foreign foods.",
      "If your stomach is sensitive, try these tips from 100+ countries of eating:  \n1. Eat foods that are still hot from frying, boiling, sauteing, roasting, etc.  Avoid buffets because the food sits. The fancier the buffet, the longer it sits.  I've eaten street food everywhere, but only if the food it too hot to eat right away.\n\n2. Buy whole pieces of fruit or vegetables. Peel them yourself.  You'll miss salads while you're traveling, but you won't get sick as often.\n\n3. Don't drink water at any temperature less than boiling. Chilling/freezing does \\*nothing\\* to kill bad stuff.  Eat some ice, and the germs will revive in your system after thawing.\n\n4. Drink fermented drinks like beer/shrubs/kombucha.  I've never gotten sick from it, even from home made beer brewed and sold from a shack in Lesotho.  (Granny poured a half liter into a plastic bag.  It was barely cool. )",

I got some stomach discomfort in India, but nothing Imodium couldn\u2019t solve.\n\nNo trick for me other than being sensible about choosing food from good sources that seem sanitary and following general guidelines - like not eating unwashed, raw fruit or veg in some places in Africa, for example.",
      "I get sick. I've had it all and on different continents. One major gastrointestinal episode can wipe you out of some healthy gut biome that it took years to develop. I've had a few episodes in the last 3-4 years. I eat a healthy diet, drink kombucha (fermented foods are good) and before travel I kick it up by drinking \"Bio-K\" to load up on healthy gut bacteria. When in doubt, eat where the locals line up.",
      "Some people's constitutions simply can't handle new foods, their guts never react well. Others have stomachs that can handle anything.\n\nThe biggest factor for most is choosing the right foods under the right circumstances from places that have great hygiene standards, and following all the usual protocols like bottled/treated water only and \"cook it, wash it, peel it or forget it.\"\n\nGood luck.",
      "Make sure you're eating hot foods.  Don't drink \"open\" water.  And often overlooked, but a huge problem for most people is over eating.  You dive right in with all the new tastes and smells and end up over eating.  Smaller portions and you'll most likely be fine.",

I got it up in Svalbard, where everything is squeeky clean.\n\nYou know where I didn\u2019t get it? India. Why? Because I sanitized the shit out of everything and only ate crazy well done food.

      "Take pepto as a prophylactic when traveling.  I had no TD or stomach upset in Peru taking it religiously, but got a little loosey goosey about it in the Dominican and had issues there.  Studies show pepto can reduce the risk or food poisoning by up to 40%.",

I have no idea of the scientific validity of this, but apparently it works for him, maybe it'll work for you!",
      "When you eat real food such as cooked or steamed vegetables, grains, different types of proteins, sushi, oysters, different cuisines etc., your body tends to process food with no issues. \n\nCan't say the same thing for the habitual cheeseburger, fries,  hot dog and chicken nugget consumer.",
      "Part of it is an immunity buildup to the bacterias of the region.  Another is that, if you're American, the rest of the world eats a lot healthier than we do.  I spent over 3 years travelling abroad and felt amazing.  Within weeks of being back in the US, I went back to experiencing chronic fatigue, bloating, and other issues I experienced before my trip.  There's something wrong with the food here.  Maybe its the overuse of GMO, maybe its the type of pesticides.  But abroad, everything seems more natural.  I dont eat a lot of bread at home as I always have issues.  While traveling, I have zero problems eating bread.",
      "I have traveled to many countries eating exotic food (Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Cambodia) and my trick is drinking a shot of their local alcohol with my meal.

      "Regarding American tourists abroad, I think the majority have very limited palates and aren't used to having any foods outside of their narrow comfort zone. I've seen American tourists in Bulgaria looking for McDonald's back when McDonald's didn't exist instead of ordering grilled meatballs or any of a similar type of grilled meats that are typical of the Bulgarian cuisine. Also, American people tend to have allergies and food intolerances which aren't typical for other people in other countries.",
      "There are three possible angles to this:\n\n1. You could just have a sensitive system, and probably are okay at home because you stick to 'safe' food. You could test this out by trying out food locally you don't generally eat, like a Thai restaurant, or a Ethiopian, etc. If you get the runs every time, you know it's not the geography that's a problem.\n\n2. Your body system could be normal, but  just not used to unusual food. If you have never eaten spicy food then definitely the first few times can upset your tummy; but you could get used to the food with gentle introduction and gradual exposure to a variety of food. Mind you, not everyone needs this gentle handling, but I've met a few who did, and went on to becoming international foodies.\n\n3. Maybe the source of your food abroad was tainted. And that does not mean you should only eat at 5 star restaurants. Street food is great at many places, and some fancy looking place may not be. I always advise to be careful about the water you drink, and to never get ice unless the source is solid (eg, the freezer in your hotel). Yes, contaminated ice is an pervasive phenomenon, and staying without ice can be a pain at times, but a little bit of caution goes a long way.  I have always looked for street food that runs out fast:  for example, busy office crowds eating quick lunches from street vendors are a good indicators of food that is well received (repeat customers) and is not stale (constant turnover).",
      "My gut feeling usually dictates where I eat.  Sometimes, it can be a hit or miss.\n\nThe one food poisoning I had was in a proper Brazilian rodizio restaurant in Lisbon.  The restaurant looks clean with a high turnover of customers, and food was good.  Unfortunately, I had a \"Bridesmaids\" moment where I had violent diarrhea and was bed-ridden for a day.  On the other hand, I've had really good street food in Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, etc. and had no problems at all.\n\nTrust your gut.",
      "A while back I heard an interview with a guy who studied tourist food illness. He said most of the time it's caused by bacteria due to poor food handling/preparing. He recommends eat only cooked food, that is served hot, hasn't been sitting around for a long time, and don't drink untreated water or ice.\n\nKinda sucks to not eat fresh fruits and veggies, but if you do there's always more risk. I suppose with some you can minimize the risk by buying them whole and preparing yourself.",
      "I\u2019ve done a fair bit of traveling, primarily in Asia and Mexico, and have rarely gotten sick. I am probably lucky and have a stronger stomach, but I adhere to some basic rules. I have no facts to support anything I am to say, so henceforth is 100% conjecture:\n\n1. Eat food made by women. Statistically women are cleanlier. Most food sickness comes from fecal matter. Find the food stand run by women. \n\n2. Never eat the curry if it is sitting in a buffet tray. Curries could have been made a long time ago and it would not look old.\n\n3. Don\u2019t eat anything if it is made in huge quantities and just sitting there. The egg roll gal that brings 100 egg rolls down the beach? Pass on those... could have been made a week ago. \n\n4. If you are traveling on a bus somewhere and stop at a rest stop and see a bunch of food sitting out for tourists, just eat the plain rice. That\u2019s cheap and they probably made it that day and unlikely to harm you. Live to fight another day. \n\n5. Avoid ice. Don\u2019t get the GNT. Get Beer and bottled water.\n\n6. Watch them make it if you can. Perhaps even before you order or sit down. One time I saw a women grab an old pancake thing and try to serve it to me instead of pouring out the fresh batter on the grill. \n\n7. Things that are fried or heated to a high temperature fresh are good. In Myanmar they these little eggs they fry up right in front of you! \n\n\n8. Take a prophylactic Pepto Bismol every morning\n\n9. Make sure you hear a crack when you open a bottle. In SE Asia they love to refill with their own cheap whiskey or whatever. Everything should be sealed before consuming if possible. \n\n10. Avoid chicken unless you are watching them cook it in front of you over an open flame. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s what I got. Again, all this could be nonsense, but it is what I do!",
      "Global traveler here: I avoid street food, small shop food and lean heavily on items served quite hot.  Some countries require avoiding salad, etc.  I had problems when I first started and learned what to avoid but I\u2019m only referring to bacteria, not food allergies to certain spices, etc.  I have no problem with that.",
      "Depends on the individual. I spent 4 years in Asia and ate street food almost daily and never once got sick. My wife on the other hand was sick almost every few months with something...",
      "Know the country you are traveling in, its safety records, and eat only hot well cooked street foods and at reputable places when in places such as some parts of India or Mexico.",
      "I don\u2019t know to be honest. I travel (used to at least, before covid) a lot and i always try new food, I never really had any problem with it.\n\nOf course my stomach can get kind of upset from time to time, but nothing i can\u2019t handle. Guess it\u2019s all about building up some sort of resistance and train your stomach to handle different floras of bacteria.",
      "I don't know about you but I have always been traveling abroad ever since I was a toddler, and I've never been picky with food so I've always eaten everything that comes my way. Stuff that's not cooked properly, things that has been outside for too long, etc.. I'm never sick from food. I'm from Sweden and I was living in Egypt for 2 years where I ate all the local foods without getting sick, whereas the tourists and stuff always had to visit the bathroom frequently during their stays. So I think you build up some sort of system that can handle different bacteria somehow.",
      "Lots of good advice on this thread. I was fortunate enough to spend about two years filming a documentary around the world on barbecue culture, so I got to eat a lot of amazing food from every corner of the globe. We had to be able to eat absolutely anything and keep working no matter what (tough job eh?)\n\nWe carried loperamide for anything that made you need to go the toilet urgently. If you got genuine food poisoning, ciprofloxacin would absolutely kill it with fire. If we knew we were eating something that didn't meet basic food safety standards, we would take the ciprofloxacin as a preventative measure, but I'm not sure whether doctors recommend that.\nAlso carry hydrolyte - if you get sick you'll get dehydrated quickly. And a lifestraw in case you are confronted with poor water quality (it filters water so you can drink it).\n\nI have a really useful old flow chart for when you get sick, I've uploaded it here: https://imgur.com/a/GSv9eUN\n\nObviously seek your own medical advice - you'd be surprised how many doctors will take you through a whole game plan for travel.\n\nHope that helps!!",

I typically, as my wife says, just shovel the food in without giving it a second thought where as she smells it, touches it, nibbles it, before even taking a full bite. She can\u2019t understand how it doesn\u2019t impact me, yet diary sends me running for the hills. So, it\u2019s okay, some people are just different.",
      "Also what you choose to eat in some countries can have an impact. Salad is healthy and I love veggies, but I never ate fresh vegetables in India. Only curries or fried/ cooked food. And only where I trusted the preparation.  Even in good hotels there can be a different interpretation of good hygiene and cooking does a pretty good job making most food safe.",
      "Eat more of \"unusual\" food at home might help, I guess? Cook something spicy. Go to Viet/RUssian/American restaurant+++",
      "I have a pretty hardy stomach (with notable exceptions when travelling, nobody is perfect). I've been all over South/SE Asia and have had the privilege to eat many amazing and pretty spooky meals with little to no regrets. I follow the following rules whenever I go somewhere new:\n\n\n1) take probiotics a week leading into, and the first week of, a new place\n\n\n2) never drink tap water in places where it is advised not to. That means no ice in drinks and rinsing my toothbrush with bottled water. No tap water IN the food you drink unless it is boiled to heck. For long trips I spent good money on a filter bottle that took out viruses and bacteria, when desperate.\n\n\n3) No uncooked fruit or vegetables the first week in a new place.\n\n\n4) No meat the first week in a new place.\n\n\n5) When eating Street food, do not eat food that has been sitting out and gotten old/cold. \n\n\n6) Only go to places where LOTS of locals are, they know what is safe. This is especially true for street food. If children and old people eat there it is probably pretty safe given their delicate immune systems.\n\n\n6) Pay attention to the cleanliness of the place you're eating. Do they wash dishes in the same pot of water, if so, is it emptied often? Is the water hot? Are there a lot of flies inside, on food? Do staff clean tables, wipe off trays, with the same gross rag? Do cooks avoid cross contamination with utensils? The items that touch food (dishes and utensils) are just as important as the food itself.\n\n\n7) if served hot, make sure it is piping hot. If cold, it should be actually cold from the fridge. Nothing lukewarm.\n\n---\n\nIt sounds like a lot of rules, but it becomes easy to pick out sketchy places when you are well practiced. I follow these the most closely when in a new country, and become sometimes more relaxed (ie meat, fresh veggies, temperature, cleanliness) the longer I am there. For example I was very careful when entering Bali, and finished a 1.5 month trip eating unrefrigerated but cooked tofu and Tempe on a rural farm in a rudimentary kitchen for a good week with no problem.\n\n\nContext is important too; how one country handles and views food safety is different than others, speaking from experience. Take time to review other travellers' experiences, trust your instincts and always carry Pepto, Imodium, Electrolyte drinks and activated charcoal for a day you are destroyed by a bad dish. I also invested in strong antibiotics from a travel doctor just in case and absolutely used them when I had truly horrible food poisoning in India.\n\n I hope this helps and you enjoy what the world has to offer, there is too much good food out there to be scared of it!",

Particularly when we went to Tanzania for a month. I had basically no fear eating everything. I got a little tiny bit of stomach bug in the middle of the trip but otherwise it was the best. I had been so sensitive to foods while traveling as a kid.",
      "I got some excellent advice about traveling in India last November ... only eat hot food, don\u2019t drink any water from bottles you don\u2019t open, if you don\u2019t see locals in a restaurant don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t brush your teeth with tap water- that got me thru the visit without any issues -",
      "Define \"sick\". Do you mean legitimately sick, like how you're \"not supposed to drink tap water in Mexico\"? Or sick as in you couldn't handle the food and it made you gag or throw up, like Hakarl in Iceland? \n\nOutside of the US, I've only been to Central America, Western Europe, and Central Europe (so far), so I know there's a lot of the world that I haven't seen. But I haven't experienced legitimate illnesses yet. But, then again, I may try \"new foods\", but they really aren't that \"different\". \n\nYou know how with Taco Bell, everything on the menu is basically \"the same ingredients, just wrapped differently\"? To me, with food, that's how things have been. For meats, you've got beef, pork, poultry, fish, and shellfish. For veggies, you've got corn, lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, carrots, peas, etc. There's soups/broths with various combinations of those things in there. \n\nThere's only so much you can do. Going to Prague and getting a [\"Bohemian platter\"](https://imgur.com/KR4iJi0).....at the end of the day, it's still \"only\" duck, pork, dumplings, and cabbage. It's done in a style that's not common in the US, so it's \"different food\", but at the core, the base ingredients are all the same. \n\n\"Trying different foods all over the world\" is only \"different\" if your regular diet is pretty limited.",
      "I think it depends on where you live and the kind of food you eat in your native country. As an Indian, I'm used to eating spicy food and a variety of cuisine regularly. Our third world hygiene also makes us immune to certain bacteria that people from first world countries are not accustomed to. \n\nI am able to eat bland European food or very spicy Southeast Asian street food and it doesn't affect my stomach adversely. As a precaution I avoid eating raw and uncooked food abroad and it helps keeping my stomach at ease.",

I drink a lot while on vacation, and good alcohol is rarely something that will make you sick.\n\n3. Yogurt is like medicine.  Eating/drinking yogurt helps prevent or cure so many gastrointestinal problems.\n\n4. Don't eat from dodgy looking places.  Science works the same everywhere, and even if the locals swear by the dirty looking food cart where the cook picks his nose and immediately touches the food look for a nicer place to try that dish.  This applies to you in your home country too.  The worst food poisoning I've ever had was from a vendor selling breakfast tacos in an airport in the U.S.\n\n5. Be prepared to be sick.  Keep Pepto Bismol, Immodium, etc. handy in your travel first aid kit.  Having what you need to get better can severely reduce your recovery time over just powering through an illness.",
      "Lots of immodium. At least that was my plan before I found out I had ton of food allergies. Still haven't taken an international trip with that knowledge though so not sure how I'll handle it.",
      "If sanitation is ever in doubt,  stick to bottled water and pre- packaged foods. \nI've traveled all over the world and can think of only 1 time when I got sick.  I almost always stick to bottled water.  I love iced drinks, but I'll order without, if I think that the water source might be risky.  \nStay away from street vendors and pass on food that looks as if it's sat out too long without proper refrigeration.  \nBuffets are risky,  so I generally stay away from those as well.",
      "Do you eat a wide variety of food at home or do you stick to the same few foods for the majority of the time?\n\nI think it's a case of 'training' your gut",
      "I think it's a matter of getting more knowledgeable about what you can and cannot trust. \n\nThailand, for example, there are a lot of street vendors selling amazing food. My first time there, I just ate what looked good. I didn't pay a lot of attention to the person who made it or their cart where it was made. I just ate, and eventually got very sick.\n\nIn Vietnam, I found that the standards for street food are a night and day difference compared to Thailand. Don't get me wrong, both were amazingly delicious, but Vietnam seemed to have very high standards on the cleanliness and freshness of their carts and food that wasn't as noticeable in Thailand. \n\nI also find that after being sick a few times, our unplanned restaurants have to have a couple of things before we will eat there: \n\n* People eating (not tourists either, but locals)\n\n* Cleanliness\n\n* Good beer\n\nChances are that a place that has those three things is going to be better quality. It's not a perfect system, but I haven't been sick since I started using it.",
      "I am one of those that never gets sick, and everyone I have ever traveled with, has. Three big things I chalk it up to: \n\n- I eat fish but no other kinds of meat.\n- I eat LOTS of fermented foods before/during/after my trip, especially kombucha and kraut.\n- I wash my hands pretty excessively while traveling.\n\nI\u2019ll eat anything - street food, fresh fruits and veggies, whatever. Never had an issue. Could also be physiology.",
      "Possibly just acclimatisation. Stomach problems from food are so common that people have jokes about all the different names for it. My personal favourites are Moctezuma's revenge and Dheli Belly.\n\nI tend to have problems when I arrive in a new location but this settles fairly quickly.",
      "I get food poisoning somewhat often. I find it to be worth it. Just use your common sense.",
      "Honestly, I mostly get the opposite reaction... I travel and eat all the local food and am completely fine. I come back to the US and eat our processed, buttery, fatty food and my stomach needs to readjust. \n\nI had one time where I was extremely sick in Korea, but I think it was from eating way too much fried food in a very short amount of time. I've never been sick on the rest of my travels.",
      "Eat where lots of others are eating. If a place is busy each day the chances are the food they sell is not going to do you any harm.  \n  \nI spend more than half the year travelling mostly in African and Latin America. I buy food in high-end hotels and from street vendors - same rule applies.",
      "I used to make fun of my dad for packing Metamucil capsules wherever he went but I learned quickly that it WORKS. I often get the runs from trying new food while traveling so I started taking two capsules/day and I was back to normal.",
      "What did you grow up eating? If you grew up with a limited diet, it will take time to develop your palate. Also as we age, we lose taste buds and it becomes easier to experiment with new foods/tastes. That\u2019s why children like plain food but mature adults can enjoy things like sea urchins and truffles for example. If you would like to be someone with a developed palate, don\u2019t be afraid to try anything new. \nWhen traveling to places with questionable hygiene, when in doubt, chilly is your answer. After you visit places like India, Indonesia, and Thailand, it\u2019s likely that you will get some ch\u00e1-ch\u00e1-ch\u00e1 there (quoting my doctor here). But eventually, your system will get used to the new diet and not only you start to enjoy those exotic foods, but you will even start to crave them. Good luck and safe travels!",
      "Honestly, it depends on what you ate growing up. If you had a really clean and non-oily diet I\u2019d say eating out a lot in countries with a large hawker food culture would not be great for your stomach. Not because the food is inferior, but because your stomach is used to processing different kinds of foods.",
      "It is weird, I have an iron tongue, but my wife has an iron stomach. I can eat spicy food with no problem, my wife is not so good with spicy food. She however will eat a sandwich be fine, I eat a bite of the same sandwich and I  barfing a half an hour later.",
      "By not being from the US where all food is processed beyond insane levels",
      "I\u2019ve also had issues with anything that was washed in non bottled water and then not cooked, like salads or veggie toppings. Staying to cooked foods might help",
      "I ate dirt a lot as a kid. I may have only had food poisoning twice in my life both while not traveling. Don't know dude, genetically you probably struck out.",
      "For me it\u2019s the opposite, a lot of food in the US makes me sick. If I drink a glass of milk here I\u2019m wrecked. If I drink a glass in Australia I\u2019m fine. It must be how they process it",
      "Same. Much as I'd like to eat, rather than just sample, many local delicacies, my system won't tolerate it and I have to be careful. I have food-related digestive issues at home as well, so it's not a surprise. I always carry loperamide tablets in case of severe intestinal cramps.  It's a shame, because I'd like to eat a greater variety, but I just can't.",
      "It might be luck to a certain degree. I have never had problems eating away from home. I have tested really weird stuff and honestly never even felt anxious about eating it. My girlfriend though knows she will most likely get bloated and all so she carry laxatives when we go on vacation just in case and she uses them overnight if she has too.\n\nEven back at home we like to change things up and we'll go out of our way to find good restaurants from other cultures so maybe it has something to do with it.\n\nEdit: Also I feel for you because trying new foods is probably my favorite thing from travelling.",
      "I eat all kinds of food when I travel. I got sick too, but not often and not violent. I don't know if \"immunity\" is the right word for it. I think it's more of control and/or moderation. For example, I usually don't drink alcohol, so I can only drink just a bit (like a glass of beer).",
      "For a lot of people food is just food, so as long as it's edible trying new things is not bad.",
      "I have had food poisoning quite a few times while travelling. Quite a few times it was after eating at a western chain that I had as a treat......looking at you, Pizza Hut in Delhi! Thought I was going to die!\n\nI recommend if you're going to eat Street food, to eat stuff that's been cooked and where the locals are lined up down the street. With restaurants it's the same-- I get sketched out when I go into an empty restaurant when everything else around is busy. Less people= food sitting. \n\nExploring places on your own is fun, but I'll often ask locals for recommendations or rely on internet reviews.",
      "I use dukoral before going, carry antibiotics, tums, ginger tablets, and diarrhea medicine   \n\n\nAlso I slowly build-up my local stomach biodiversity by slowly by not rushing into eating street food.  I have travelled much of Asia for up to 3 months at a time. I count on a couple of periods of diarrhea (mild) and if I eat the wrong thing (dumplings sold on the street in 35-degree temp) and the diarrhea continues I break out the antibiotics.    \n\n\n [https://dukoralcanada.com/what-is-dukoral/](https://dukoralcanada.com/what-is-dukoral/)",
      "Part of it is also being critical of what food you eat. \n\nDon't drink the tap water if it's unsafe. If it can bring infections, I don't even clean my toothbrush with it. \n\nI always properly wash my hands before eating anything abroad, even just snacks. That's like 30 seconds, with soap. (Alcohol if there's no running water)\n\nI also avoid leafy vegetables in street food and ice in drinks.\n\nThat's not to say that I never got sick, of course... And I always have to try new things really carefully as I'm allergic to the most random things. (Did you know that it's possible to be allergic to jackfruit?)",
      "Just comes down to how your body handles food. Some people are sensitive and some can withstand more. I've drank water from the tap in Mexico and been completely fine, but had the wrong kind of meat sauce in my spaghetti in Russia and was WRECKED. if you're trying to avoid being affected then the only real advice I would offer up is trying to stick to plain food. Nothing fancy and no spices.",
      "One thing to consider is that people's digestive systems are often misbehaving when they travel, anyway, and it's not specific to the area's food. Eating too much, not eating enough, eating more unhealthy food (e.g., fast food in the airport and fried street foods), drinking more alcohol, being stressed and exhausted from long flights and time changes... None of those things should make you completely ill, but it's not uncommon to be irregular or have indigestion or whatever.",
      "I take probiotics morning and evening the week before and during travel. Seems to help quite a bit.\n\nThere are days of travel where we don\u2019t know what food options we\u2019ll have, so if our options end up looking too sketchy we make sure to have some \u201csafe\u201d foods on hand. Like granola bars from home and some fruit or bakery goods from our destination.",
      "I have a very sensitive stomach, and find if I chug a glass of water 15 minutes before eating anything new, it helps immensely. Also don't drink pop, caffeine, or alcohol while eating new foods.",
      "iron stomach.\n\nwho knows?  different people have different reactions to what kind of foods they can tolerate.  gut flora is unique to people and is a massive contributing factor.\n\nI've eaten in plenty of what's considered developing countries, especially street foods and never felt sick.  For whatever weird reason, I got extreme vertigo after eating at a buffet type place in Riga 2 years ago.  Literally felt my head spinning and ended up vomiting my entire lunch and had to glue myself to bed.  Fortunately felt better the next morning.  Nobody in my group felt the effects and they ate the same stuff I did.  Can't explain it.",
      "The sketchier the location, the better the food.  I never get sick from little local hole-in-the-wall places, but have before when going to \"fancy\" restaurants that cater more to tourists.",
      "No idea.  When I have a patient going overseas I give them a prescription of Cipro.\n\nThat being said we loved eating street food in Thailand.  I did fine, my wife had some lose stools and my daughter got hit hard.",
      "You get sick for two reasons. One is if you have eaten something that contains a bacteria, that is proper sick, and you can not build an imunity to bacteria. The other is if your body just doesn't tolerate a certain food. Some people claim to 'have a cast iron stomach, but it isn't to bacteria, they just tolerate unknown foods better.\n\nWith respect to eating bacteria, you can't build an immunity. If anyone consumes a bacteria, they get sick, but the body can learn to react less strongly to a bacteria it has experienced repeatedly, so not react by giving you explosive diarrhoea or projectile vomiting.",
      "Eat different foods while at home",
      "The trick is to always eat cooked food and avoid buffet style food. You have higher risk to have food poisonings in a cold salad buffet in a five star hotel than eating a skewer of meat prepared on a corner station.   Buffet and self serve, the food is left exposed and can be contaminated. \nIn some restaurant, simply see or check if they reheat batch of food pr cook fresh ( i can have issues with some curry dishes due to that) \nSpice will just give you cramp and a quick run when you take too much of them in the first go. Most of the time in Asia at least, the spice is served separately for most meals, you put what you want. I had less than an handfull of issues in ten years in Asia.",
      "I do get sick.\n\nOnce, in Thailand, I ate some road side shrimp that smelled amazing, gave me food poisoning... I also ate shrimp from the exact same lady at the end of my trip.\n\nI won't describe what came out of both ends after a trip to a delicious, yet deadly for my stomach, mackerel restaurant in Busan.\n\nI live in China currently, and will literally eat anything, I have never had an upset stomach here. When my dad visited (like me he eats anything), he lasted one day... cue two weeks of rice and frequent toilet visits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess it's all down to your stomach and how it digests food/any potential bacteria.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Let me just add, getting sick will not stop me from eating - if you ever get food poisoning, make sure to look after yourself by taking appropriate measures and staying hydrated.",
      "It depends what kind of food. If it's cooked food, no problem. The issue is usually the water. We have our own gut biome, bacteria in our environment at home and stuff we are used to. In the US, we put antibiotics in everything and treat water heavily. When going overseas, these new bacteria aren't bad per se, just not something the body is used to. I have found the more I travel, the less commonly this happens",

      "Ive gone RTW a few times, and basically your body just adjusts.\n\nYou *will* get sick. The bacteria from the area is different to that which you're used to back home. Some places are notorious for it - Central and South America (Montezuma's revenge) SE Asia (Delhi belly/ Bali belly) etc.\n\nYou'll get the shits for a day or two, your gut flora gets used to the local bacteria, and then you're good to go.\n\nThe ones you want to avoid are parasites and viruses (and the really bad bacteria as well). Dont go drinking a litre of untreated local water on arrival and you'll be fine.\n\nOtherwise it's not a question of if, it's a question of when. I generally brush my teeth with the local water, have drinks with ice cubes made with the local water and so forth. *Gradually* expose yourself to the local bacteria and when it eventually does hit you, it's mild and sorts itself out in a day or two.\n\nI bring three things in my first aid kit; painkillers, band-aids and Imodium (or any other anti-diarrhoea drug).\n\nIt's just the price you pay for travel, and immersing yourself in the local foods. Embrace it and you'll be fine.",
      "Define sick?\n\nLike yeah I've had some diarrhea or constipation here or there but not enough to be memorable, just take a pill and move on. My tip is mostly just to ease into it - don't go straight from daily burgers to daily beans and rice or vice-versa - and diversify with smaller bites instead of massive meals.\n\nI've had proper food poisoning twice. Excruciating pain, only able to move back and forth from the bed to the bathroom and required antibiotics, hydration efforts, etc. You can carry activated charcoal tablets, these are said to help, or even take antibiotics with you just in case. But it's difficult to avoid. I know exactly where I picked it up both times and there were no major red flags. Likewise, my ex picked up equally bad food poisoning from salmon sashimi at a high end restaurant in the states. Sometimes you just get unlucky. If this is happening to you frequently though, you should definitely discuss it with a doctor.",
      "For me it's the magic of Dukoral. I'm also not very careful about food hygiene (except handwashing of course), often eating stuff that falls on the floor etc. and I'm really into fermented foods, so maybe that has strengthened my gut flora?",
      "I've not gotten sick very often in decades of travel.  I follow some common sense precautions that others have already mentioned.  But life is a risk so you can never perfectly prevent things.\n\nI'll try about any kind of food and haven't noticed that unusual food items per se are the culprit.  But as others have noted, some people have a more sensitive system.\n\nEven properly cooked food can be ruined by being touched by some worker who didn't wash his hands after wiping his ass.  Or by your own hands if you touched the contaminated restroom door handle then touched your mouth without washing.\n\nAnother thing that can cause difficulty in pinpointing what meal may have caused your illness, is the variety of incubation periods for the culprit bacteria.  It can take anywhere from a couple of hours to several days (you can google the stats for different kinds).  Often we blame the last  meal we ate before the puking/diarrhea began, but frequently that may not have been the source.",
      "My attitude towards food at home is the same - always try something new, eating at dodgy places etc...so going on holiday is always a break for my stomach, even if it has to put up with chilli coated tarantula and sour horse milk.\n\nIf I\u2018m go somewhere where I\u2019m not expecting ti have a proper toilet for a few days I will bring both stool hardeners and laxatives, but to date I\u201dve never had to use them.\n\nKFC always gives me trouble though - both in Sri Lanka and China (after two weeks in North Korea) I had some KFC as comfort food. Both times I shit myself.",

Buy bottled water to quench your thirst and brushing your teeth.\n\nRegardless, arm yourself with medication for the inevitable food poisoning.   \n\nHaving said all that, worst case of food poisoning I ever had was from McDonalds!",
      "One thing that I do is I ONLY eat food that is cooked thoroughly. This means avoiding fresh veggies and fruit, the water content can have things your body isn\u2019t used to.

      "I am not a doctor, but I am an educated patient with SIBO and IBS. I know people with IBS and SIBO get food poisoning much more easily than other people. Another thing that can influence your chances of getting sick is your level of digestive enzymes. If your pancreatic elastase is on the low end of normal, you might get food poisoning more easily than other people since these enzymes are a protective measure against bacteria. You could take an OTC enzyme like Enzymedica\u2019s digest gold (1-3 capsules)\n\nYou could try taking a couple of herbal antimicrobial tablets with each meal abroad. That\u2019s what my doctor recommended I do going forward. Something like Biotics ADP oregano or Berberine Complex.",

Getting generic chinese food once a week isnt fundamentally different from american food.",

Salad is not as it gets washed with water, sometimes not the best quality. Also try papaya enzymes... They're amazing.",
      "Biggest thing for me is the local water: i never drink it. I'll get sick immediately. There are microbes in the water that my stomach is not used to. When going to other countries, i will only eat food that i see boiling or being fried in hot oil. In 3rd world countries, i never eat salads or cut fruit, or cold meat or fresh vegetables. I would buy fruit from the market myself, wash it myself. I buy bottled water or filter my water.",
      "It also depends on the environment you were raised in. People that live in less developed countries/countryside eat food that sometimes may not be well cleaned or well prepared or has specific bacteria from the animals they raise. So they develop a better immunity system than those that spend their entire lives eating supermarket food, so it can support a larger pallete of foods.\n\nFor example I am Romanian and I was raised with fresh milk with lactose, fresh eggs and unprocessed meat from my grandma in the countryside. Dairy is no problem for me but for my uncle who is Spanish it was disastrous to his stomach.",

If eating street food go somewhere popular where the food is cooked fresh and has a fast turnover, not left sitting around for long periods of time. Look for hygienic practices, washing hand, food storage, especially the existence and use of refrigeration. Some places in Asia have a hygiene rating, check this. Good luck",

No one can eat it and avoid it.\n\nYou can either not eat local food except certain kinds that don\u2019t expose you to those bacteria (which is just a miserable way to travel) or you\u2019ve been exposed to those bacteria elsewhere and they don\u2019t sicken you.\n\nThe only other option is to get sick and deal with it.\n\nCarry short-course antibiotics unless you\u2019re staying the 6 months or so necessary to adjust.\n\nEven people born in those places have to deal with it visiting after a long time because evolution is real and the bacteria are often much changed when they visit.",

Travelers get sick, tourists avoid experiences that may lead to getting sick.  \n\nNever consume third world dairy or gas station sushi.",
      "It's all about developing a habit and then your body just being comfortable with it. If at a young age, you tried out so many different foods, chances are you are going to have a digestive system that welcomes almost anything. But if your childhood was almost a single kind of food, then chances are you are going to have trouble. I would suggest you not have any tablets or medicines for the same, but just go through the initial trouble, and very soon your digestive system will get used to the fact that it needs to welcome all kinds of food.\n\nJust don't go out trying unhygienic foods to test your stomach, that's the only thing to keep in mind. As long as it is healthy, your stomach will welcome it eventually.",

I\u2019ve been to India six times, and the first three or so, minor food poisoning was pretty much par for the course. Not constant, but often enough, and it happened to basically everyone I travelled with as well. Last three times though, didn\u2019t really happen any more.\n\nSo anecdotally at least it seems like there\u2019s something happening there. Not even necessarily that the food is bad, just different bugs your body isn\u2019t used to and builds a tolerance for over time like mine seemed to. I don\u2019t really get sick anywhere any more.\n\nBut there is probably also some kind of natural immunity as well. I don\u2019t really ever get sick in any other way at all. As far as I can tell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever actually had the flu. I thought I had but when discussing it with people, all I had was a slight cold.\n\nAre you particularly germophobic? I don\u2019t tend to care much, and never really have, and I suspect that sort of lifetime of exposure is probably good for your immune system, save for a few really nasty bugs your body just can\u2019t defend against.",

Ironically I think I'll probably do better in other countries than the US, I can't handle any of our fried and salty stuff but moderate spice/pickled/what have you doesn't bother me.\n\nAre bottle drinks (esp water) decently common in most countries?

      "Some people are simply more sensitive than others. I don't think there is any magic solution, but there are some things you can do to lower the risk of illness during a trip.\nThe first is obviously taking proper precautions when traveling. That is apply proper hygienic measures, eat well prepared food at busy places and avoid dodgy water. In my experience the water and hygiene are the most important ones so use hand-sanitizer before eating. \nThe second is to train your body. If you're extremely hygienic at home you will build little resistance. E.g. don't throw away food just because it's a day past the use by date, no need to wash your hands before every meal and snack etc. \nThird make sure your health and immune system is in order before you go. Plenty of people have deficiencies impacting the immune system. Eat healthy and varied, exercise, get enough sunshine etc.\nFourth I've been told that drinking coca cola helps against bugs and though hard to tell for sure, it seems to work. Though I would not recommend it, in theory you could also use other preventive medication such as norit.  \n\nIn my experience common sense goes a long way. But you can never be 100% sure and I personally do take chances as food is imho an important part of the experience, also off the beaten track options can be very limited so you can't be too picky.",
      "Actually many food poisonings and other things might not come from the food you eat but from eating with dirty hands. We traveled through some quite sketchy areas (china/indonesia) and ate a lot of interesting food, we made a point sanitize our hands before eating and did not get sick, while on many trips before (mexico/brazil) i had gotten food poisoning.",
      "I never had any digestive issues except when I was on a tour with a lunch buffet on a small island off the yucatan that gave me montezumas revenge for a few days even after I came back. I don't think there was any other food alternative available at the time. \n\nI went on a hiking tour in Hawaii that ended up being a food tour that consisted of eatting random leaves and fruits growing on the side of the road. We got a couple guys shaking a tree to grab some kind of strawberries. Look up the reviews before going on tours, that's for sure. \n\nGood luck OP, get some digestive tests done and avoid those foods and make sure the waiters understand and know you're issues when ordering.",
      "Eat vegetarian.\nI never had food poisoning, while my travel buddies usually got at least one in every other country.",
      "I went to Japan for two weeks, and though I\u2019ve eaten Japanese food here in the US, I spent about 4 days of my 15 day trip having diarrhea issues thanks to my body not being accustomed to something over there. Still don\u2019t know what caused it, and I didn\u2019t have any issue readjusting to foods in the US when I got back. I also didn\u2019t have issues eating the meals on the planes into Amsterdam, Denmark, or Russia, and the issues with food in Japan started on my second day, but once they cleared up I didn\u2019t have issues again.",
      "I just eat it. It's not a bad idea to avoid some places street food though... esp. if its like meat or eggs and highly perishable stuff.   \n \nI've only gotten sick once from travel specific food in Egypt, boat operator used bottle water for tea... ok good... but then after washed the damn cups in the nile (raw sewage dumped into it), lost 15 lbs in 2 weeks from that one. Otherwise never had any issues (in A LOT of trips).",
      "I would also say to prep your body by experimenting and eating a diverse range of foods before traveling in order to train your stomach to handle new ingredients and spices. Would make sense if someone who lives on bread and butter (with USDA standards) are all of a sudden knocked out by the introduction of fresh foods that are not hormonally enhanced or pumped with chemicals that are banned in basically every other country but the US.",
      " Eating fast food and processed food make digestive system extremely weak. Sterile food filled with antibiotics leave your guts in a poor state to handle food that might require actual work from your body to be processed.",
      "I can eat just about anything. Even rotten food (ewwww but no ill effects). It just depends on the person. I've never had food poisoning that wasn't alcohol related. I am generally skeptical of people who claim food poisoning, we evolved to eat practically rotting meat etc...",
      "Can\u2019t emphasize the efficacy of D U K O R A L enough, as mentioned by surprisingly few in this thread.\n\nAlthough a little on the pricy side (in Canada, anyway) this oral vaccine is available over the counter without a prescription. It prevents cholera and E.coli contamination (read travel diarrhea) and should be taken in two separate doses at least one week before your departure. The Dukoral vaccine lasts up to 6 months.\n\nI have pretty much the weakest gut constitution and get sick quite literally everywhere I go, be it NYC, San Diego, Mexico City, Guatemala, Berlin, Marrakech, London, etc. I was all over Southeast Asia this past February and after taking Dukoral I did not suffer a single stomach upset. This is unheard of for me, especially given the rampant street food consumption (think Luang Prabang nightmarket where on Friday the vendors have fresh product and by Sunday every stand is only selling whatever cooked dishes are left over from the past two days). Ate some very adventurous meals that I definitely would have passed on back home and somehow did not suffer the typical consequences.",
      "I debated to say something or not, as some people hate essential oils, and I'm not sure if it's alright to suggest specific product, but... \n\ndoTERRA On Guard.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, I used to carry a bottle of pills just in case my stomach acts up to food while traveling, but me and my family have been using On Guard Beadlets for the past 4 years instead and it's worked just as good. It's all natural, so much better than pills, and doterra's quality is safe. But don't take my word for it, if you look into the ingredients, there are official studies done on their anti-bacterial properties. And obviously I'm not making money off of this... so, give it a try if you like. People who have used it know it works.",
      "One of my golden rules is not to get dehydrated. Getting sick isn\u2019t always related to food. If you\u2019re on the move a lot of in strange climates, you are likely to get dehydrated more quickly than usual. It\u2019s not just about drinking water either. Those isotonic drinks are good. I especially like one called Pocari Sweat. \n\nAlso, beer and soft drinks don\u2019t count as staying hydrated."

      "Amsterdam is overcrowded by tourists and a bit boring compared to other cities in Europe. How about Vienna? I like its style that is in a nice way a bit old fashioned. Good food, art, relaxed cafe culture. No hectic whatsoever. You've excluded Italy, but I have to mention Venice, which is mindblowingly different. That said, exclude the summer months. Also Berlin isn't bad. The city is open 24/7 and vibrant. Lots of cool music, art, little shops and restaurants that are continuously changing.",
      "Since you mentioned food and architecture, a consideration is San Sebasti\u00e1n (Donostia) in the Basque country of Northern Spain.  Food is incredible, beaches are lovely, the film festival is in September, and you are a short distance from one of the most stunning architectural accomplishments in the world - the Guggenheim museum in Bilboa.  I started to cry when I first saw it, it is just stunning.  If this is much too far away for your travels, consider the small town of Menton, not too far from Lyon, or visit the incredible castles and gardens of the Loire valley..again, fairly close to Lyon and very accessible by high speed trains.",
      "Hungary hands down. Budapest. Vamhaz, Halasz Bastya, all the old buildings downtown with the gun scars still visible from 56. Great food and wine if you like things a little heartier. Most of the Bathhouses (be careful tough and check the internet first).",
      "I feel like by saying no to Spain, Italy, Istanbul, the UK, and Paris, you're eliminating some of the best food cities in Europe! Lots of cities in those countries have great architecture too, as do Paris and Istanbul.\n\nFor architecture, have you considered Strasbourg? I haven't been but the cathedral looks incredible. Otherwise maybe somewhere in Germany like Munich, Cologne, or Berlin? Vienna may also be a good choice.\n\nAmsterdam also checks all your boxes.

Also one pound a day is an extreme luxury for me but I use it as a upper limit to stop myself from over packing.",
      "Didn\u2019t read all the comments but the trick is to know your calorie needs. I\u2019m tall and fit so I eat anywhere from 2000 to 6000 calories per day depending on what I\u2019m doing and for how long I\u2019m doing it. \n\nWithout seeing all the packaging of your food in the pic, I\u2019d guesstimate that you have about 10,000 ish calories in the picture. If you use the 2000 calories per day per person plan, you really only have enough to eat for 2-3 days for 2 of you. You won\u2019t die or stave to death if you spread it out equally over 4 days but you will be hungry when you get back. \n\nMy person needs call for 2000-3000 calories per day depending on what I\u2019m doing to stay away from being hungry. So for me I would do 10000 just for myself for a 5 day trip knowing I\u2019ll eat before I get to the trail and I\u2019ll eat after I get back to my car. I might have a little left over but I don\u2019t want to run out. \n\nA smaller person doing a low difficulty trip might get by with the 1500 per day or even less. But calculating calories is the best way to plan for backpacking and camping trips",

      "Just came back from a 4/3, my main advice is more snacks fewer meals!!! Having a little something sugary really helps when you\u2019re halfway up a tough ascent, or salty when you\u2019re sweating. Overall though you\u2019ve got more than enough food - rough rule of thumb is 1.5 lbs/person/day and eyeballing you\u2019ve got probably like 30-40% more than I bring",

If you\u2019re traveling to an area that requires a bear canister, you may have trouble fitting all of that. If it were me, I\u2019d probably sub out the breakfast dried meals for something more compact like individual oatmeal packets and nut butter packets (I usually do two oatmeals and a tablespoon of a nut butter for protein) just to save space in the canister. \n\nThat also looks like a lot of salt, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but that will dry you out pretty quick. Knowing my own body, I would probably sub out some of those snacks with some less salty ones. I was just in kings canyon and even with drinking 4+ liters of water every day I was still feeling thirsty and a little dehydrated from the heat and exertion. IMO it\u2019s not worth having to add extra water consumption (meaning extra stops or potentially extra weight) because of the food. \n\nBut those also look like really yummy options!

You cant expect to match your intake to your loss but you should aim for intaking around 2000-2300 calories depending on body size, weight. This is probably a lot, so write down how many calories each day is and cut or add food from there.",

Basically whatever sounds good where I don't need to keep it refrigerated. I just use a trangia alcohol stove. If you're going to burn lots of calories per day then plan on that extra food.

It would for me, though I might have a more sensitive digestion than others, some people wouldn't have an issue. I would bring some Imodium just incase.\n\nTo avoid some salt you can bring things like plain oatmeal, you can add nuts and fruits. Though be careful with dried fruit, i would get organic because the non-organic fruit has a chemical coating to prevent oxidation which also causes diarrhea depending on how much you eat.

Anything short of the former I personally would be struggling to eat half this haul on a 4 day 3 night trip.\n\nIf bulk is more your issue, I would suggest you get higher calorie camp meals and chop that load in half, skip the dessert meals. Maybe bring some oatmeal and peanut butter for breakfast instead of bagged meals, cut that load down even further.\n\nAnother suggestion, to cut down on single use plastic waste, you can buy things like trail mix and beef sticks in bulk bags and take something reusable to carry smaller rations with you for easy access on the trail. Refill it from the big bag every morning before you set off.\n\nComing from big wall climbing, where weight to calories ratio is paramount, carrying four bagged camp meals @ 500 calories each per person per day is just out of the question.\n\nAll this is to say, yes - this is definitely enough food.",

      "Some people may not like the choice due to space/weight, but I love it. Sometimes when you put in a lot of miles it\u2019s hard to eat. Having something like this makes a big difference in enjoying your food vs having to choke it down. Thanks for sharing.",
      "Port this on r/ultralight and watch the people having strokes.\n\nLooks good, btw.  I do a lot of UL trips, and also heavyweight trips where I bring food like that.  It's a toss up as to which is more enjoyable.  The good food is great, but the extra weight is murder on my old joints",
      "I like taking time to make food on all my backpacking trips. It usually takes around 15 minutes to cook something. I add an egg and cheese to my ramen because it makes it more filling. I make egg sandwiches with whatever meat there is on sale, be it bologna or ham. I don\u2019t use bacon because the jetboil doesn\u2019t cook bacon too well. I bring bacon if I can make a fire",
      "So hard to cook like this and follow food LNT practices",
      "To each their own, but that is way too much weight for me. I usually stick to dry food on short backpacking trips. I have a little pot set that my gas fits inside of. I usually bring it in case I need to boil water. Plus, I look forward to having an elaborate meal when I get back."

    "selftext": "Ok, so I\u2019m packing food for a 3 night backpacking trip around Mt. Hood with my teenage boys. That means a lot of overthinking every detail, something I actually enjoy. I\u2019m sure some can relate \ud83d\ude42 Packed a few of these mountain house beef stroganoff with noodles for dinner one night. Now these weigh 4.3 oz, and supply 580 calories. That\u2019s about 135 calories per ounce. I also packed a couple of these Thai kitchen pad Thai noodle kits which weighs 9oz and contains 805 calories. That\u2019s about 90 calories an ounce. Mountain house costs $10, Thai kitchen costs $2. And honestly the sodium in the mountain house meal is just unacceptable. I\u2019m not saying the Thai kitchen dinners much better health wise. But there\u2019s a lot of salt in jerky nuts etc\u2026 the stuff I like to snack on. So lowering that is nice.\n\nTLDR: you can spend about 80% less on food and it may increase your pack weight about 6 or 7 ounces for a 3 dinners.",

      "These Mountain House and other backpacking freeze dried meals are meant to have an excess amount of sodium because you typically need to replenish all of the sodium and calories you\u2019re burning off from all the hiking you\u2019re gonna be doing. Definitely not meant to be eaten as a \u201cnormal\u201d meal. Now if you\u2019re going on an easier backpacking trip then yeah it\u2019s probably excessive. I\u2019d say if it\u2019s an easier backpacking trip then you\u2019d be fine with the Thai noodles or Kraft Mac n cheese but you\u2019re putting in some big miles then you might want more than just that. I usually pick my food based on the trip I\u2019m doing. The bigger the trip the more calories and sodium (electrolytes) I plan on packing because I know that I need to replenish or I\u2019ll be cranky!",
      "I would stick to regular dog food.",
      "This is an interesting take, and hope it works for you guys! There are lots of factors in nutrition. I've used a lot of the (admittedly expensive and natrium-rich) hiking foods available from many brands\n\nWhen going for a budget line, I've combined Knorr or Bl\u00e5 Band non-hiking food pouches (different taste pasta sauces and rice meals) with added home-dehydrated ground lean beef. The pouches cost about a quarter of hiking foods but lack in protein, which is remedied by the beef.\n\nI've ended up with mild hyponatremia during a 9 day hike despite eating mostly freeze dried hiking foods on that trip, the amount of sweating just drains you of electrolytes to some degree.",
      "The reality is that either one will be fine for your trip.  When money was tight, I would rely on Kraft macaroni and cheese (no butter or milk) for backpacking meals.  I have a friend that I'm backpacking with in a few weeks that is vegetarian, and brings a medley of instant soup mixes for dinners.\n\nNowadays, I prefer freeze dried meals for a few reasons:  \n\\- Most meals are of the rehydrate-in-the-bag variety (and eat out of the bag).  Not having to wash dishes is a luxury, but a nice treat.  \n\\- Freeze dried meals don't have any smell, so critters are much less likely to get into your dinners (this ignores any other food that might be stored with your dinners).  \n\\- There's no need to drain noodle water somewhere near camp, which can also attract critters  \n\\- For those of us trying to eat more protein and less carbs, I find that there are better options on the freeze dried side",
      "I like mountain house simply because I need that \u201chot meal\u201d encouragement \u2026.after a long hike the last thing I want to do is sit in my hammock and eat some bland semi room temp. tuna packet\u2026\u2026much like the dog, I am very food motivated",
      "i can usually have one or two and be fine but a long weekend of 2-3 of these meals a day will absolutely destroy my gut. at best, i\u2019m farting up a storm. at worst, it ain\u2019t pretty. i have found tho that the gluten free backpackers food makes me feel much better",
      "FD meals are awesome but I wouldn't go with Mountain house. Pinnacle Foods is my go to. They're not good for 30 years like MH but that's probably a good thing. BTW their Jalapeno Cheddar Biscuits and Herbed Sausage Gravy is effing bomb!",
      "Few things I didn't see in the first several comments. Dinner can either be the best or worst meal on a backpacking trip\n\nSome trips I hike 15-20 miles per day or are gaining serious altitude, and I just don't have the energy to cook good food at the end of the day. It's hydrate, set up camp, eat, then straight to bed. I can get more calories in the morning when I have more energy. Usually protein powder and oatmeal on these kind of trips. Also altitude can ruin my appetite so having food I enjoy is key. These trips are more about the destination then the journey \n\nMost of my trips are easier 8-12 mile days depending on elevation change. On these trips I enjoy dinner time. Cooking and eating are great times to socialize. I've hiked in fresh meat and veg for the first night or two. It's easy to make pan fried breads. Dried potatoes are good on their own but can make potato cakes. Chicken and dumplings. Making pasta with ramen noodles(surprisingly a decent amount of protein in ramen). You can buy freeze dried veggies cheap and add packs of chicken. Spam tastes great in the woods. Get creative. Bring deserts or even a small plastic bottle full of bourbon. These trips are more about the journey then the destination\n\nPS liquid IV powder is a great way to stay hydrated. Especially if you end up packing the bourbon \ud83d\ude09",
      "For 3 days for 1 person I would do regular food and have fun with it. 3 days for 4 people I would do freeze dried and a combination. \nMy go to lately has been ramen with an egg in it, cheese on top, and seared spam or beef jerky in it. I like the spam cause I can have spam, eggs, and cheese for breakfast as well.",
      "I use good to-go backpacking meals. Very delicious variety of meals. Order online goodto-go.com or found on Amazon. you can get the double serving for about $15 and filling enough to split on a short hike you don\u2019t have to worry so much about calories. They offer breakfast and lunch single/dinner double. On the meals I have compared they offer healthier options.\n\nEdit\u2026 forgot to mention I use primal freeze dried dog food for my picky pup. She eats it dried or with a little water added.",
      "No, not worth it. But it makes you feel like you're camping and that's fun! I like them because they're different.\n\nIf you have to pack in water, then just bring real food. If you drive up to your camp site, then just bring real food. If you have to go on a long hike that ends in water access, then freeze dried helps you out, but I would still recommend high calorie bars.",
      "Instant ramen and canned food are best for camping.",
      "Before taking any freezecdried foods on a trip, eat one AR home first. Sucks to get out there and your only meal tastes like what your dog leaves in the yard. \n\nWorth the extra expense to sample first.",
      "The Thai is just ramen with sauce. Very important \"Add meat and veggies\" on the front of the package. You could get instant ramen packs for $0.35 each and add some free sauce packets from your local panda express to get  the same nutritional value.\n\nWhat you pay for with camping food like Mountain house is the freeze dried meat. Otherwise instant soups, potatoes, rice,vegan chili... Lots of cheap light instant food out there. \"Camping food\" gives you the protein though.",
      "first of all ,if its a small dog you should not feed them people food, we lost our little girl from feeding her people food, it is devastating to their liver and kidneys",
      "Just back from 4 nights. I ate one night of mountain house spaghetti (the only one I like)   Two nights of angel hair pasta into which I mix a tuna packet, a handful of sun dried tomatoes and olive oil or pesto (yum). And one night of Knorr brand chicken and rice mix. Knorr offers many meals which are inexpensive and found in most normal grocery stores. \n\nIn sum, backpacking food doesn\u2019t have to suck or be pre-packaged and expensive. I bring hummus, cherry tomatoes, carrots, celery and peanut butter. Plums and mandarins hold up well too. \n\n2000 miles backpacked to far!",
      "It\u2019s a matter of priorities, I think. \n\nYou can pay more for freeze dried meals with 100% (plus some, in many cases) of the nutrients you need. Or, you can carry more food but spend less. \n\nI always opt to carry less, even if it means spending a bit more.",
      "Check out Backcountry Foodie! Aaron is a registered dietitian that has hundreds of recipes that are ultra light and nutrient dense.",
      "I would agree generally at least on the Mountain House meals. They are not great, but then they are the budget level entry option - budget level flavor and ingredients.  Not my favorite freeze dried food by a long shot. There can be a big difference in quality, ingredients, nutrition, flavor, and texture from one brand to the next. Sometimes they can be worth it, especially some of the better brands. I think they\u2019re great to keep around (since they last for several years usually) for trips where you don\u2019t have the time to menu plan, buy ingredients, and assemble meals. \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be a choice between cheap low cal per ounce quick cook grocery store staples or more expensive high cal per ounce freeze dried.  There is a big range of food options suitable for backpacking out there.  If you have an interest in creating your own meals, I would encourage you to experiment more.  There are a decent variety of instant or quick cook ingredients that can be brought together to create a really good trail meal that cooks/hydrates a few minutes with interesting flavors and much better calories per ounce. 130-160 calories per ounce is achievable - no need to settle for 100 cal per ounce if you don\u2019t want to.",
      "I am not a dog. Remind me fellow humans where we put our unlimited food supply of dog food again?",
      "If you\u2019re not a food aficionado like me, then yes. Totally worth it for nutrients and convenience to help you on your backpacking trip. \n\nBut if you want to be extra like me hahaha you can make your own dehydrated meals! It\u2019s extra work, but ultimately up to you :)",
      "Your dog seems to approve of both but I use cheaper food because freeze dried is like 15$ per meal here in Canada now. So expensive I don't consider it worth it.",
      "I really like the huel savory set up. You get three big bags of dry food with a little cup to make it in for like 70 bucks. I\u2019ll pack them up into zip lock baggies to take on trail and mixed with some instant mash, is *chef\u2019s kiss*",
      "I didn\u2019t even look at the food. Just your cutie-pawtootie hamming for the camera",
      "If you\u2019re back packing and carrying a lot of stuff then I think so. They come in Handy. Food moisture weight adds up quickly and can add weight quickly. Especially food for three days. A little more expensive but worth it in my opinion. They\u2019re also honestly not half bad too tbh but anything is tasty when you\u2019re seasoning with hunger.",
      "I really just prefer making my own food these days. Tuna / salmon / chicken packs are clutch. I make bags of couscous or pasta with freeze dried veggies and seasoning already thrown in. All that with a little hot sauce, extra salt, and nutritional yeast is great. I also bring electrolytes for the Nalgene rather than replenishing them with super salty food",
      "Move the food out of the way I wanna see that DAWG",
      "It says two servings, but if you're hiking any distance is really one. Your body can use the calories and sodium. If I'm only going 3-4 days I take fresh food for the first day, and packaged foods for the rest of the trip. I usually mix it up between ramen, oatmeal and freeze dried. I'd be more concerned about being familiar with your equipment, and knowing the bushcraft basics.",
      "If you have the time to make light weight food that holds up well on the trail then by all means do that but if you don\u2019t have the time and want something fairly good tasting and appropriate nutrition for the trail and light weight, Mountain Home has been making these meals for decades and they\u2019ve mastered it!  I still love several of their meals and have been enjoying them for many years.",
      "Not sure if the op will see this but right now mountain house are on sale at REI for 25% off plus an extra discount of 10% if you buy eight or more. Makes them around $7.75 each for the regular ones or $9 for the high protein pro pak version. It\u2019s usually the best price of the year, even better than the big boxes of them with the advantage of getting to pick exactly what you want.\n\nBe sure to check the calorie counts and plan extra food for anyone who chooses the lower calorie meals.",
      "BEEF STROGIIII\n\nso at philmont they give us mountain house food, and beef stroganoff was a lot of the staffs favorite meal so it would get affectionately named \u201cbeef strogi\u201d and they would get excited when that was coming up through the meal rotation"

      "I'd recommend doing the trip, then checking what was not needed, what you missed, etc. \n\nThere are different styles of hiking, and finding your balance of what is worth carrying and what is not, depends on many factors.\n\nMany beginners bring too many clothes - you need certain types of clothes for things to be safe, but bringing spares is not a good idea. Many beginners also bring too much food, but even that's not something to make decisions on, as I took way too little on my first outing.\n\nGo for it and have fun!",
      "To be able to backpack you\u2019ve gotta learn to be okay with being a little uncomfy. Maybe less clothes? It\u2019s hard to know what you could maybe get rid of since we don\u2019t know. But whatever you were like \u201ceh I *might* need this, so I\u2019ll take in just in case\u2026\u201d you probably don\u2019t need. Truly you just need the basics, tent sleeping bag sleeping pad clothes (reasonable amount) toiletries first aid water - food - filter  flash lights, and anything else that is a necessity that I forgot. Otherwise, you probably don\u2019t need it. \n\nEither way, it\u2019ll be a learning experience and you\u2019ll figure out by trial what you do, and don\u2019t need. \n\nBe safe! :)",
      "Yes. A couple of things, though. Could you post a new view of your side? It\u2019s hard to tell in this photo, but it seems like there\u2019s a lot of slack in your shoulder straps\u2014they should be much more snug. I think the common saying is that 80% of the weight should be on your hips and 20% on your shoulders, or something like that.\n\nAs for weight, that\u2019s a lot. Try to aim for less than 20% of your body weight\u2014ideally closer to 15%. You need a comfortable bag and sleep system (tent, pad, sleeping bag, and I like an inflatable pillow). You\u2019ll also need something to clean water (pills or a purifier) and something to hold it (a water bladder, and a single-walled stainless steel cup to boil water). Bring freeze-dried food, a cheap camp stove, a knife, some paracord, a poncho and bag rain cover, and extra clothing suited to your scenario.\n\nIf you\u2019re in bear country, bring bear spray.  With that, a bear cannister or small bag to hang your food in a tree (google how to do it right). A first aid kit is essential\u2014there\u2019s a lot of debate on what to include, but bring what you know how to use and add a tourniquet.\n\nFor toiletries, bring a bag with something for chafed thighs or backside, wet wipes, toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, toilet paper, medications, a small microfiber quick-dry towel, and feminine hygiene products if needed.\n\nAlso bring a flashlight with extra batteries, your phone, charger, battery pack, GPS (if you want it or need it\u2014I have one with SOS functionality), compass, fire starter (lighter, ferro rod, etc.). Did I mention a metal bottle or Nalgene? And don\u2019t forget fuel for the stove.\n\nI think that\u2019s everything I bring\u2014it might be overkill, but I\u2019m 200 lbs and fairly fit, and this entire setup comes in at about 28 lbs.  You likely wont use all of this or may not feel you need it all but its a list that hasn't steered me wrong. \n\n  \noh and a map of where you are going printed out (I always bring two).\n\n  \nI will check my bag later and edit this post if I am missing anything.",

      "I was on a short hike recently where a van full of college students were doing an overnight through the university's Rec center. So it was not surprising that they all had very large and (what I considered to be) very heavy looking packs. It was all gear from the Rec center (which is a great thing and I was glad to see them taking advantage of it). However, I was completely shocked at the shear amount of clothing they brought with them for an overnight. They all seem to have packed full blown, cotton based sweat pants, sweat shirts, heavy winter knit caps, jackets, gloves, etc for haning around camp. I passed them the next day while hiking out, and it was all leggings, boots, heavy hiking pants, different sweatshirts, etc, etc. Which all of that was fine because it was only a 2 mile hike back to the trailhead. \n\nIt's hard not to pack your fears and wind up with a 40lb pack. Without actually knowing what environment you're going to be in here are some suggestions...\n\nClothing\n \n* One set of clothes to hike in made of materials that will dry quickly (no cotton): Shorts, shirt, medium weight wool socks, comfortable athletic shoes that you already have (DO NOT go out there in new boots or hiking shoes!). Leggings for if it's chilly. A hat or Buff for your head. Also, a bandanna is great for hanging on your shoulder strap to wipe sweat off your face (and they dry quickly).\n* One set of clothes to wear at camp and/or sleep in: Comfy socks (do not have to be wool but wool is still a good idea as a back up pair of hiking socks), shorts, shirt, some sort of light head gear like a fleece cap. \n* \"Utility\" clothes: Rain gear (Frogg Toggs are relatively cheap and light) and a mid-weight fleece top. A lot of people also bring a down jacket if they have one. I have found that my dry sleep shirt + mid weight fleece + my wind shell (frogg toggs) typically keep me comfortable in the evenings and I don't take a down jacket anymore. \n\nFood 3 days / 2 nights\n \n* Breakfast (x2): pop tarts and breakfast style bars make for a quick and easy breakfast that you can eat while packing up.\n* Lunch (x3): anything you can put into a wrap. I'm fond of the spam individual packets, cheese, and mayo (lots of calories and sodium). The individual tuna or chicken packets are also a popular choice. Chicken+mayo/mustard+salt/pepper+almonds make for a good lunchtime wrap.\n* Dinner (x2): Freeze dried or dehydrated meal. Only time you have to boil water. I usually bring something like fritos or cheezits to go along with dinner.\n* Snacks (x12): I like to plan for at least 4 snacks/day. Trail mix/nuts, meal bars, granola bars, candy bars, Kind bars, peanut butter packets, Anything you like but \"dense and small\" are better. \n* xtra meals: bring one extra breakfast and lunch. \n\n\n* Hydration: Bring some electrolyte powder mix. At least one for each day (I usually bring 2/day) I like the Gatorade Zero stuff myself. If it's really hot and I'm sweating, all also through a pinch of salt into the mix.\n\nAs for the \"regular\" gear....hiking poles, headlamp, a spoon, a micro-fiber towel, and a battery bank for charging your phone  are basically it.\n\nFirst aid / hygiene gear...not a lot needed here either for just 3 days. Some Ibuprofen and tylenol is good. An anti-diarrhea medication is good. Some tape for hot spots (before they turn into blisters) is also good. Toothbrush/toothpaste. You can use the micro-fiber towel to wash off at night if you want. Toilet paper (and a couple of ziploc bags to carry the used TP back out). \n\nLast are the \"luxury\" items. Some people bring camp chairs, or things like inflatable pillows, etc. I personally like having a pillow (or a bag I can stuff my extra clothes into to make a pillow) because I sleep on my side.\n\nLast bit of advice (just in case you don't know this stuff)....\nYou need sleeping pad between you and the ground to stay warm at night. The fleece beanie/cap for night will also help keep you warm by keeping your head warm. Sleep in less clothing (shorts and shirt) to let your sleeping bag do it's job and insulate you using your body heat. You don't have to buy expensive stuff if you don't already have something. The amazon $20 hiking poles are great. Wool socks and fleece beaning from Walmart are great. \n\nGood luck on your trip!!!!",
      "I did 8 days a couple months ago, and my big 3 was under 5 pounds, yet I still topped out at 35.  Since I've gotten back, I've re-evaluated everything.  I got a small scale to weigh things, and that weight would now be under 30.  Food is 1.5 - 2 lbs per day.  I have a 3 day backpack coming up and should be around 17 pounds including food.  It's always good to be prepared, but I went through my \"miscellaneous\" tote, and eliminated 3 pounds of redundancies just there.  I'd used a Jetboil MiniMo for years, swapped that out for a Windmaster and titanium pot, saved another half pound.  And my 2 lb tent had been destroyed in the Patagonian wind, new tent weighs 1 lb.  It takes time to cut weight thoughtfully (and money) but worth it.",
      "Ide loose the jeans go for something more conformable,\nGo walk for a few miles with it see if the weight is gonna cause any problems, never a bad idea carrying more food then you need, and just be senable, like if u got 3 pots, probably don't need 3 pots shit like that",
      "Based on weight I would think it might be , but  I would just inventory and make sure you don\u2019t have unnecessary items, highly doubtful, but rule of thumb is around 20% of body weight, more if longer duration, think about water , do you have reliable water sources on your trip ? That could be a weight saver , don\u2019t shed important safety items and food of course , but maybe you could carry one less water bottle full of water , I know personally I had a lot of junk food to get my calories right , so many ways , those pre packaged Tuna packs are light, so many ways to do it really , unfortunately lightweight gear is a big way to achieve this as you do it more",
      "* **40 lbs is a significant weight for a 50-mile trip, especially over challenging terrain.** Experienced backpackers often aim for a base weight (without food and water) of around 15-20 lbs for multi-day trips. Even with 5-7 days of food and water, exceeding 30-35 lbs can be taxing on your body.\n* **Carrying twice the expected food is a major contributor to excess weight.** While it's always good to have a little extra, doubling your food supply adds a lot of unnecessary pounds.\n* **An ultralight 2P tent is good for saving weight compared to a traditional tent, but if you're solo, a lighter 1P option could save even more.**\n* **Packing \"about all the gear you could imagine\" suggests you might have included items that are not essential for this specific trip.**\n\nhaha! suggestion from Gemini \ud83d\ude02",

      "I say send it WITH the caveat of having a plan to bail if necessary (should always be an option anyways) \n\nI used to carry heavy packs (40+lbs) cuz I had a bunch of second hand heavy and old stuff and I eat a lot. And I'm not sacrificing any food or layers for warmth lol. It's exhausting but if yr used to it and u got the mind for it, you can def do it. If this is yr first trip you'll learn what works for u. When I first started I learned to downsize and overtime collecting lighter versions of the things i needed I got lighter. Then I went heavier again cuz it just meant I could carry more fun foods lol. It's your pack, you'll find what works for you. \n\n\nIt is true however, heavier packs will be harder on your joints in general and especially going down tough terrain (scrambles, screes, steep declines) . Please use yr trekking poles. Also be mindful of the difference of yr center of mass if yr doing any class 3 and up hiking. \n\n\nNot everyone hikes light and it's 100% okay to have a 40lb pack.

Not everyone needs to go the ultralight route but sometimes the use of that language is just for marketing. I didn\u2019t get the lightest stuff and my pack is anywhere between 20 and 30 pounds  depending on the trip. That\u2019s including food and water. So far I\u2019ve only been doing trips of one to three days. I agree with someone\u2019s suggestion of doing a short overnight gear shake out trip first if at all possible.",
      "If you can, reduce weight. Grab your sleep system, essentials, and JUST your food. From there, cut weight. Bags, wrappers, using ziplocks. Should be down to 30lbs if not more\u00a0",

      "The best way to not bring too much food is to count calories. Figure out how many calories per day you need for backpacking (probably about 3000), multiply by the number of days, and bring exactly that many calories. For a week trip I would add one or two days of food just in case. I write a list with the name if each item and how many calories it is. This also helps you from packing too much low calories stuff that adds weight.",

      "Rough terrain for me means no trail runners. I\u2019ve had a pair of Danner boots for 30 years for these types of hikes. Also, sock liners and wool socks. Blisters will kill your trip more so than no food (don\u2019t ask me how I know). RunGoo or any anti-chafing cream will do. Apply liberally, even on top of your toes, and check your feet as soon as you feel discomfort. I also use it on my thighs and man parts. Re-apply at lunch if it\u2019s hot and you\u2019re sweaty. Know how to use moleskin before you hit the trail.  For 3 days, only 1 pair of clothes will do, except undies. Always fresh undies. Water is a huge weight. Plan out where you can get water and filter water. If you can get by with 1 SmartWater bottle, do it. Have fun.",
      "Aim for around 15% of your body weight, max 20%. Or hiking a considerable amount can be quite miserable. Remember this may include 2l of water you may have to carry through the day. Take only dry food, nothing canned. Reduce spare clothes to the minimum.",

I\u2019m a small female and my base weight (without food or water) is about 12-14 lbs. l live at high elevation and backpack higher elevations and this weight would do me in. My experience is people bring too much clothing (and clothing which takes up too much space), too much food (I dehydrate my own so can portion how I like it), as well as use equipment which is too heavy. Look online for \u201cLighterpack\u201d and enter your gear to see where your weight is coming from.",
      "My suggestions:\n\nDrop 15 lbs off the packed weight, because averaging 18 miles a day with that much weight will be brutal.  You will find pain in places you will not be able to adjust the pack to accommodate.  \n\nIf you have double the food, drop almost 1/2, also plan to eat the heaviest meal on night one and morning two. \n\nIs the packed clothing too much?  Get over being clean, it is a luxury you only get when off the trail.\n\nAfter this trip you will know the comfort items that matter to you and what doesn\u2019t.",

It's feels incrementally exponential. (Is that a thing? )\nAlso, I would MAYBE do 40# for 30 miles, 50 is gonna be rough.\nI think a big part of it is how filled your pack is.\nI try not to go over 80%, though I've done better and worse. The load gets further and further from your center of gravity, and takes more energy to stand up straight, much less keep your ballance over TERRAIN.",

There is most likely a lot of things you don\u2019t need if your bag if it is that heavy and you\u2019re sleep system is UL. \n\nFor context, I\u2019m a 6\u2019 190# guy, and that\u2019s about how much weight I\u2019m carrying, and I\u2019m usually packing the tent and all the food for my wife and I.",
      "It all depends on you and what you\u2019re comfortable with! I will say two things:\n1) You probably don\u2019t need to go overkill on food packing\n2) Wearing a 40 pound pack while standing with plenty of energy in your home feels a LOTTT different than how it feels actually backpacking, ESPECIALLY for a trip such as hiking 50 miles of rugged terrain in just three days. Speaking from experience here, while you want to be prepared you also want to make your load as light as possible so you\u2019re not absolutely miserable while backpacking. Although, I don\u2019t want to assume; if you\u2019re incredibly physically fit and backpack with a similar weight frequently you should be fine. You look to be a similar size & muscle tone to me, so imo a 40 pound pack is going to start really wearing on your back and decreasing your stamina levels, especially for hiking over 10 miles a day. Hope this helps!",
      "...ah. Your phrasing was quite ambiguous to me. I couldn't quite figure out what \"twice as much expected food\" meant. However, I am now confident that you mean:\n\n2(Amount of food you expect to need)",
      "It depends on your level of comfort and what you expect. 40lbs is a heavy bag for me (6\u20193\u201d 220lbs 44yr). I can do it of course but choose to not. :)\n\nAs others said try it out and make a note of what you didn\u2019t use and dwindle down. \n\nAs an example I did a 100km trail over 7 nights (so lots of food), and my starting bag was 32lbs. Very rocky/technical trail. I\u2019ve also been hiking for many years. \n\nEnjoy the trip!",
      "The rule of thumb is 20% or less of body weight. Food, water system, sleep system(tent, bag, pad), extra socks and underwear, rain jacket & pack cover, knife, first aid, rope, lightweight tarp, a little bag of toiletry essentials, a trash bag, and maybe a book if I've been reading lately.\n\n50 miles in 4 days would be pretty rough for me. My favorite trail is 32 miles and I do it in 4 days.",
      "Are you bringing your own water or using a filter? 40 lbs seems a bit heavy for a 3 day trip. I used to carry 30 lbs for weekend trips, but that would be me overpacking and carrying up around 3L of water for me and the dog just to be safe. My dog carried her own food.",
      "I once did 35 miles on a road with a pack a little heavier than this in a day, I was around 145 lbs and in the best shape of my life. It was one of the worst days in my entire life.\n\nThis will be a mistake.\n\nYou need a shelter, trash bags, a small pot, food, salt and spoon (you always need a spoon), a really good knife and a shitty bigger knife, and a lightweight water filtration system with a lightweight container for water. One shirt in the pack, a hat and a couple bandanas. A small first aid kit (especially bandaids and OTC painkillers, something for stings or burns maybe if you can't learn some medicinal plants before then).\n\nThat's about it. If you learn to pack like that and you totally can, I believe in you, you'll be set forever unless it's cold. If it's cold add appropriate gear.",
      "This seems like too much to me, but I usually think less is more. Maybe considering adjusting food since you mentioned that you have twice as much as you need. I am also questioning the trip plan since you would be walking roughly 16 miles per day across three days over rugged terrain. That seems like a lot to me since trips I have taken in rugged terrain usually didn't exceed hiking more than 10 miles per day. If you extended the trip to four days hiking 50 miles you would instead be hiking 12.5 miles per day which would be much more comfortable and more time enjoying your trip. Extending that extra day would also support bringing the extra food if you still wanted to keep everything.",
      "By the end of day 3 it won't feel like it weighs 40 lbs. Even with all the food you have consumed it'll feel a lot heavier than 40.",
      "If it takes 40 pounds to feel like you are comfortable and adequately prepared then 40 it is.  My last trip was 7 days and with 9 days of food and no water my pack was 42 pounds.  It was in July and I got severely dehydrated.  So water breaks are super important.  It sneaks up on you.  There was plenty of fresh moving water in the mountains.  But it got me anyway.  I really don\u2019t know how to get your weight down without really expensive gear.  And even then it\u2019s not going to save you a whole lot.  I always err on the safe side.  Med kit and battery pack to keep phone charged. I use my phone as a satellite texting and tracking device.  So it has to stay charged. Airplane mode through the day.  Just remember you need to stay warm and dry.  Need to have lots of water. Good shelter.  Food is heavy.  My food was 10 pounds.  It was all oatmeal and dehydrated meals I make myself and granola bars. Plus my coffee kit. Probably put coffee kit as number 1.  For sure you need to do a few miles with your gear load out and see how it feels on you. Don\u2019t forget to do hills too.  If it\u2019s too much you will know pretty fast.  Me and my friends bags all seem to be 40 to 45 pounds when we go.   Add a few ltrs of water on that and it\u2019s a pretty good load.  We definitely feel it on long uphills. One more thing take care of your feet.  Nothing worse on a hike than your feet crying.  Give it a go.  Have fun.  Make adjustments for your next trip. I dig the face paint.",
      "Might be a bit too much, but better safe than sorry. You\u2019ll know when you get back, based on what was used and what wasn\u2019t\u2026  for 3 days I usually only take the food needed, no water, but some form of water purification system, hammock/ cover, 1 change of clothes, jet boiler, flint and knife, and utility knife, mini shovel, toilet paper\u2026I try to go as light as possible\u2026 but it depends on the time of year/ location and what I plan on doing during the trip, like maybe rock climbing, hunting or fishing",
      "Hard to say without knowing seasons, place, what you are doing etc.. etc.\n\nBut when i started backpacking i overpacked. I still do to some degree, but that is some luxuries i afford myself.  When you get home id take a look at what you used vs what you didnt. Of course some items will be \"just incase\" stuff that youd bring anyway, even if you didnt use it the last time.\n\nTo me double the food seems a bit much, depending on where i hike i bring enough food for an extra days worth of food. If its in a place where id struggle to find anything or get to civilization id might add a some.",
      "Go to lighterpack.com and enter all your gear and the weight of each item.  A food scale from walmart is good for weighing. \n\nLast time I went to Big Bend for and overnight on the south rim my pack weight was about 18lb plus food/water.  I brought LOTS of water since it was going to be HOT and theres nowhere to resupply on the hike.\nYou can see all my gear i packed here. \n\nhttps://lighterpack.com/r/1vhw2x",
      "Totally depends. But don\u2019t take 2x as much food; take 1 extra meal, and some snacks. \u00a0\n\nFor 3 days I\u2019d have a pack weight of about 9-10kg excluding extra water (but including food, fuel and 1 full water bottle), or about 20-22lb, assuming low temperatures don\u2019t get to freezing (I\u2019d be feeling cold below about 4C).\u00a0\n\nBTW torso length on that pack is too long, it will push your head forward and slip off your shoulders sideways and dig into your lumbar spine. Get one fitted properly at a shop and get them to tell you your torso length and show you how to adjust load lifters. \u00a0",
      "40ibs for a two day walk essentially? Long story short you will be regretting that weight a few hours in. You should be aiming towards half that weight with food and water included. R/ultralight should be your best friend after this trip",
      "Try eating your planned food for a day and see if it will be enough or too much. I usually plan on packing no more than 20% in extra calories. Also, meals need not be all freeze dried. Try mixing it up. I usually don\u2019t eat a proper lunch, but have a load of snacks. It helps reduce the time stopped and gives me flexibility on where I eat. \n\nAlso, the single heaviest item will usually be water. Get a printed map that shows potential watering holes. Make sure to prefilter the water before you fill your bottles unless the water is perfectly clear. Those sawyer filters get clogged easily. This could be as simple as putting a folded handkerchief over the opening as you fill to filter out light sediment or using a millbank bag/canvas reusable bag. I prefer a millbank bag, but I cut and stitched mine in half to make it more packable. Everyone has a preference on how much spare water they want to bring. \n\nSet a hiking schedule and mostly stick to it. I\u2019ll usually take no more than a 5 minute break 1-2 times per hour unless it\u2019s a good stop for interesting things. By being disciplined in a hiking schedule, you have so much more time for other things like bathing in a waterfall or making a large fire. \n\nRemember, leave no trace and don\u2019t be a dick to other people. Everyone relaxes in different ways, so don\u2019t harp on the hikers playing music before 10pm. After 10pm, though\u2026",
      "I backpacked around Asia for 7 months, and my pack was smaller than this!\n\nGranted - I didn\u2019t pack food, but this does seem like a bit much\u2026",
      "Google \"NOLS equation for food quantity\". They break down\u00a0how to estimate food by weight related to activity. That search should show details in the AI overview from their Outdoor Nutrition book.",
      "Agree with others regarding pack fit - that pack is way too big.  My 13 year old son is very tall and skinny, and I\u2019ve found that ULA makes a kids circuit with adjustable torso length (not found on their typical packs).  Plus you can select from a multitude of hip belt sizes.  I think I got a 26 inch for my son.\n\nRegarding your stuff\u2026 rule #1 is hike your own hike.  We all learn what we truly need versus what we think we might need by getting out and hiking.  Having said that, some things that you need:\n- Water, water filtration/purification \n- Shelter\n- Sleep system: pad and quilt/sleeping bag\n- Most likely rain gear.  In the summer you probably don\u2019t need rain pants.  Above about 55 degrees or so, I end up sweating as I hike faster than the jackets can move moisture out, so things get damp.  For that reason, some people use an umbrella in the summer months.  But they don\u2019t work in heavy vegetation.\n- Some warm, clean, and dry clothes to sleep in and/or use as insulation (depends on where you\u2019re hiking and the weather).\n- Food, about 1.5-2 lbs per person per day\n- First aid: could be as simple as some Motrin and band aids.  You don\u2019t need snake bite kits or giant pre-built first aid kits in a big pouch.  In addition to some bandaids, gauze, and gear first aid (DCF tape), my kit includes some medications (Immodium, Benadryl, Tylenol, Flexoril, OxyContin, and cipro antibiotic).  Intent of my kit is to be able to treat myself to the point that I can hike out to the next town/road.  My kit fits in a small ziploc sandwich sized bag and weighs a couple ounces at most.\n- Mot people use some sort of stove and fuel.\n- Most people use their phone for GPS navigation; bring a charger.  10k mah is fine for a week.\n- Headlamp \n- Toiletries: TP, wipes, toothpaste, toothbrush, maybe some sort of powdered soap and small quick drying microfiber towel.\n- Small knife.  The smallest Swiss Army knife has never failed me.  You don\u2019t need a 7-9 ounce Gerber multitool or a Rambo survival knife.\n\nFeel free to take along comfort items.  On short trips, I\u2019ll take a stool, sit pad, deck of cards, notebook, camp shoes, etc.  But when I\u2019m carrying more than about 2-3 days of food, those items are the first to get removed.\n\nThings you don\u2019t need:\n- New clothes every day.  I wear a pair of socks every day while hiking, and I sleep in a clean/dry pair of socks.  So I\u2019m only packing 1 pair of socks, a pair of running shorts, and a lightweight UnderArmour styled quick dry shirt. If it\u2019s cold and I\u2019m hiking in pants, I\u2019ll take 1 extra pair of underwear.\n- A giant knife.\n- 2 of anything\n- Extra gizmos for your tent.  Manufacturers footprints are always heavy.  If you really want a ground cloth, buy a giant roll of window film.  It\u2019s polycro, cheap, and your footprint will weigh about 1-2 oz instead of 6-10 oz.  You don\u2019t need interior lighting other than your headlamp. \n\nAs others have said, I say to (1) get a pack that fits, and then (2) try and right size your gear, (3) go on your hike, and then most importantly (4) assess your gear!",
      "I find most of the time it\u2019s not much difference in pack size and weight between 1 day and 4 days. Beyond that obviously get bigger with food but the essentials are the essentials no matter how long you\u2019re out",
      "There is not enough info to tell. It will depend on what type of food did you take (cans vs freeze dried), do you have access to fresh water or a way to produce it, how is the climate changing between day and night and during the trip, do you take additional equipment like tripod, camera or need extra stuff for an event along the way, are you going with group and can share equipment.\n\nI think it is doable with much less weight and you'll quickly learn how to make it but again, it depends on a lot of things you are not sharing.",
      "Someone is always going to tell you to pack lighter and try to convince you that you can get by with a plastic bag, a match, and a can of tuna (/s but entirely) Only you can decide what works for you and truthfully, the only way you can know is by being humbled by the pack. I have never been down worse than my first backpacking trip. I had a TEA KETTLE and a WHOLE ASS FRENCH PRESS in my pack, Samwise Gamgee style.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0y0zyfq6bze1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2197b2cecfc3a784e46125fa615803285612cffd\n\nIt was a truly tragic experience. I had a severe overhaul of what stayed and went and got modified. I think I've mostly gotten into my groove and have a system that works for me, but I'm certain that the next trip I go on will lead to more changes.\n\nIf you're going for 3 days, bring a few pairs of underwear, extra socks, MAYBE clothes to sleep in depending on the weather or if it rains, but you'd be better off leaving dry clothes in the car. I need to learn to take this advice myself and accept that smelly is better than heavy. look for package free alternatives for toothpaste (like toothpaste tabs) and maybe cream whole body deodorant (like lume) you can squeeze the tiny into a smaller container, any pills in a Ziploc. make ziplocs your friend of you haven't already.\n\nGo through your pack and try to make as many little swaps as you can to save ounces that quickly turn to pounds. You're going to question why you let yourself pack so much regardless, but make it a little less painful. anything survival related, don't skimp on, though. some of those things can be modified or possibly cut, but unless you're me and bringing a full sized tea kettle and French press, it's probably a good idea to have it and see if you need it.\n\nPS: for the record, I do still trudge on with a tea kettle. it's a part of me now, however it is a very lightweight, compact one that houses my entire cooking/food system, keeping it organized and in one place,  and has been more useful than my pots have ever been since I don't usually cook and use it to rehydrate food and make coffee. It's worth the weight for me and you'll find those things for you, too."

      "I dehydrate my own food. One of my favorite meals is trail enchiladas. I dehydrate refried beans, use powdered enchilada sauce, and TVP. You can use corn tortillas or corn chips, it really doesn't matter if they break.\n\nI add water to the Ziploc containing each separate ingredient. In my cook pot, I layer the ingredients once they are reconstituted. Some sauce on the bottom, followed by either the chips or tortillas, some beans, TVP, then more sauce for a few layers. After I set up the layers, I pour just a bit more water on top, cover my pot, and start it on my Jetboil stove. It usually starts to bubble pretty quickly. I let it bubble for just a few minutes, then I wrap the entire pot in my towel (I carry a hiking towel for multipurpose use).

I was hitchhiking in a valley and the locals invited me to swim in a stream.\n\nPhoto 6: Hiking\nIn fact, I didn\u2019t know where to go, so I just hitchhiked to a village. The locals invited me to go hiking near the village.\n\nPhoto 7: Hot Spring\nThere are many hot springs in Iran and I stayed in a great hot spring hotel. $8 per night. I stayed for a month. I went to the hot springs every day.\n\nPhoto 8: Stroll in the park\nIranians love parks very much. My biggest hobby is to go to a corner of the park and sit and rest. I also enjoyed street performances.\n\nPhoto 9: Eating\nNeed more explanation?\n\nPhoto 10: Drinking coffee\nI have never seen a country where people love drinking coffee so much. When I had nothing to do, I went to teahouses and coffee shops sometimes.\nThe locals usually greet me warmly and then take me to their homes to stay for a few nights.\n\nPhoto 11: Going to the mosque\nI have a habit of going to the mosque to sleep for a while, replenishing my energy and washing myself before continuing hitchhiking.\nOnce I went to a mosque and the students who were studying Islam warmly invited me to sit with them.\n\nPhoto 12: Street Food\nSometimes when I was hungry I just bought a snack on the street. The vendor owners are usually very welcoming.\n\nPhoto 13: Going to the market\nShopping.\n\nPhoto 14: Going to the fish market\nShopping.\n\nPhoto 15: Going to the gym\nLocals love to invite me to the gym to exercise with them.\n\nPhoto 16: Randomly invited to have tea\nWhether hitchhiking or walking on the street. I probably drank dozens of cups of tea every day!\n\nPhoto 17: Exchanging money\nUsually before exchanging money, I would tell them a joke to make them laugh. They will give me a better exchange rate!\n\nPhoto 18: Prayer\nFriday prayer routine.\n\nPhoto 19: Haircut\nOne of the most interesting places in Iran is the barbershops.\n\nPhoto 20: Still learning to dance\nIn some places, locals have to practice traditional dances before attending weddings.\nOnce you get to the wedding, you can dance like crazy!\n\nI am a male traveler.\nI hope that my sharing of this post will not be twisted by gender, religion, or politics topics.\ud83d\ude05",

You seem to be at that packs limit but you only need a 1-3 pounds of food for how long your going so it may all fit. \n\nGo for it though. Nobody cares what you lug. If you\u2019re happy carrying a bunch of stuff for looks then you\u2019re happy. There\u2019s room to leave duplicate/unnecessary items and shave more than 6 pounds to make it a more comfortable hike though.

      "Honestly. This seems like a ridiculous amount of food. I\u2019d eliminate a few things and add a jar of peanut butter.",
      "Total calories look a little light.  Though I don\u2019t know the length of your first and last days. If you are hitting the trail after decent lunch that can make the first days food kind of light.  I estimate 2500-3000 cal/full day.\n\nAnd the weight is not great.  I like most of my food to be closer to 140 (technically I shoot for 4cal/g).  Sun Chips are probably pretty bad as they are low in fat (if the tuna is packed in water, same story).  Hiking food is kind of the funny inverse of a normal \u2018healthy diet\u2019.  Carbs/sugar and protein are 4cal/g, fat is 9cal/g (you can add the different pieces in a label and get the total calories).  So fat is good for calories density.  I carry Fritos or tortilla chips (slightly greasy ones).  \u2018Healthy chips\u2019 are generally bad as they are healthy because they are filling without having very many calories.  Though here you want the calories without having to carry more weight.\n\nYou can also easily \u2018bump\u2019 some foods by adding something.  Olive oil is a common add.  With the ramen you might be able to add something like some powdered coconut milk (I get this at my local Asian market) or a peanut butter pack (or both).  A lot of things like noddle are pretty light on calories and for me really serves as a carrier for other calories.\n\nDepending on what type of eater you are, they can be other advantages to eating more fat.  Some graze constantly and can survive on sugar.  I\u2019m not good at this and too much sugar can make me feel icky so I steer towards more fats and proteins.\n\nIf you have the time and interest, the Gear Skeptic on YouTube has a great series in backpacking food.",
      "The food you prepare for a trip or picnic?",
      "For me that is way to much salt. Sudden increases in salt in your diet cause diarrhea, which is something I want to avoid at all costs on trail. If you eat regular food that doesn't have tons of salt in it, then switch to trail mix, ramen and snacks you will have problems.  If you eat tons of snacks like this and some fast food and ramen every day, then you will be fine. You need some salt to replace what you sweat for sure, but if you add up all the salt in your pictures it would be ridiculous.\n\nOne thing to note, you may think to get dried fruit to counter act the above problem. That won't work because we spray dried fruit with an antioxidizing  chemical to prevent discoloration, which causes diarrhea. I learned that one the hard way. You can get dried fruit without it, it just looks brownish.\n\nI high recommend bringing some loperamide (imodium) with you just in case.\n\nIdeas to avoid the too much salt/diarrhea issue, plain oatmeal for breakfast, not the flavored packets. Pasta for dinner, not like a freeze dried premade thing. Angel Hair pasta cooks really fast, or the tiny little circles. You can then use some of the pasta water to mix with tomato paste from a tube. Peta bread is really great for lunch. Peta bread and a jar a peanut butter goes a long way and is extremely calorie per pound efficient. Couscous is another time honored camping food. It's ridiculously easy to cook, and comes with zero salt. But it's so bland you definitely want to add some, a bouillon cube at minimum. Goes great with pepperonis.\n\nThe other I wouldn't like is the pancake mix. Having to dirty and clean a bowl to mix it, then having to bring a large fry pan to cook it would be too much work for me.\n\nGood luck! May your butthole stay unchaffed",
      "Whoa! 14000 Cal's for 2 people for 4 days? Did you mean per person? Backpacking is no joke and there is no way 2 people can only eat 3500 Cal's a day combined. I budget at least 3000/day for my 6' SO. We are lucky I'm only 5' tall and only need 2000. That being said your food needs to be way more dense. Nix the pancake mix for sure. General rule of thumb is 1-1.5 lbs of food per person per day. You aren't too far off that (would be 8lbs) but can definitely pack some more Cals in!",

Very satisfying!  \n\\- a little squeeze bottle or single-use packets of olive oil can be useful both for cooking and to add some calories.  \n\\- little packets or baggies of salt, pepper, and any other spice you might like - they're light and can improve a meal quite a bit!  \n\\-dried or candied fruit  \n\\-nuts  \nIf you're used to drinking coffee or tea in the morning, don't forget those.

I often do not take a stove with me 2) calorie to weight ratio 3) amount of waste I will be left carrying \n\nWaste: I recommend buying in larger quantities and packing food into your own containers. It reduces the chance that the waste from wrappers are accidentally left behind. Stasher bags are silicone, dishwasher safe, can be heated too high temps, and are reusable after thousands of washes. Check them out. They\u2019re pricey but worth the cost in the long run. I can\u2019t remember the last time I bought and used a ziplock bag at home.\n\nReduce the amount of waste overall.  Why do you need 6 individual jif containers? (Why in t the world does such a product even exist?!)  That\u2019s so much waste. You can spoon peanut butter into a reusable container that is large enough to fit what you need for your trip. Or, even better, you can buy powdered peanut butter that weighs significantly less and is easily reconstituted with a small amount of room temperature water. You can buy fresh olives and put them into a container - no need to buy individual packets.  The tuna is not a lot of bang for your buck in terms of calories to weight compared to other foods and has very few carbs. 110 calories isn\u2019t anywhere close to what you want for a backpacking meal. You\u2019re also going to be carrying that empty packet that is extremely difficult to rinse clean in a sink, think about how bad that is going to smell after a day. Starkist is also not sustainable sourced and should be avoided in general if you want to continue to enjoy tuna.\n\nWhat you have there looks heavy. The tuna and olives have water that\u2019s just dead weight. \n\nReduce and reuse."

      "Why pack this now? Do you have free luggage? \n\nI was at an airport and this woman packed all her food for a week. She was checking the bag and it was over weight. Of course the airline wanted to charge her $200 for the bag. She literally had $2 boxes of pasta in her bag. \n\nCarrying little bags of pancake mix, oatmeal, etc. onto an airline makes little sense unless you're destination has no food sources. It sets off every red flag possible. You risk having to toss it or pay extra to bring it. \n\nFly to your destination, go to a grocery store, and buy what you need. Come with a premade plan. For example, you can come with the baggies already labeled with what will go into each bag. \n\nIn this situation, being frugal up front will likely cost you more in the end. \n\nSide note: If you're paying for luggage, you need to ask yourself if it's cheaper to buy everything in that bag at your destination. For example, If your clothes are from Walmart, it doesn't make sense to spend $75 each way ($150 total) to bring a bag of clothes that you can buy for less at the Walmart located at your destination."

      "If you learn how to count your calories and macro and micro vs. the type of hiking you will be doing and the weight you are carrying, plus your own weight, you\u2019ll know. There are a ton of forums and articles on this to show you how to do it right and it\u2019s honestly pretty simple. It is also surprisingly pretty accurate. I have a super high metabolism, so I brought some olive oil to curb the extra when I first started using this technique and I was covered comfortably and didn\u2019t have to deal with the extra weight. I will include a link to one of the more simplified examples of this. \n\nCheck out https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/hiking-and-backpacking/ultimate-backpacking-calorie-estimator/\n\nEdit: also a TON of plastic. Remember you have to pack that all out. Since you have already bought all of these items, either take a large ziplock for trash and learn the hard way (I did, I think we all do), or unwrap and repack in different reusable lightweight containers. Next time, I recommend going to the bulk section of your grocery and bring your own containers. I also love to make my own dehydrated foods. You can make soups, dried fruit salads, kale chips, etc. You can dehydrate just about anything in the oven, so you don\u2019t need to buy any fancy machines. https://thesaltypot.com/dehydrating-foods-in-the-oven-101/\n\nLast thing: please be sure to include about one gram of protein per pound of your own body weight per day. Your body needs it, trust me. Looking at your menu there is definitely not enough protein. It\u2019s only two days, but for next time try to make sure you\u2019ve got good fats, a salt, a healthy carbohydrate and fiber, and protein. These four will quite literally save your life.",

      "After planning a trip to Norway for 3 years and never getting to do it, in late 2017 my wife and I finally decided to go for it. After a few months of planning, dehydrating food at home and buying some extra gear, we boarded the plane to Bod\u00f8 in June of 2018.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBought a basic map of the islands from a book shop in Bod\u00f8 and ran to the ferry for Moskenes. This was a back-up map. Main navigation was done on a Garmin Oregon 600. You need detailed TOPO maps on the Lofoten, as often the trails are non-existent. Especially in the beginning of the season.\n\nCamped for a night at a camping site in Moskenes and the next day headed for the hills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the following three weeks we mostly slept in our 3 -person 3-season tent (which works out for 2 people + gear), with the occasional stop at a camp site to re-charge batteries, re-stock supplies and shower (not to be underestimated after 9 days in the rain!). Only took the bus a couple of times to connect long gaps in the planned routes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe started off with backpacks weighing 28+kg for the wife and 36+kg (lots of photo gear) for myself, not including 3l of water per person which we filled along the way.... Which, by the way - as one fellow hiker put it - is probably the tastiest water in the world. It took us about a month to adjust to the \"high quality\" tap water back home (still in Western Europe).\n\nThere is no ridiculous heights on the Lofoten but the elevation spikes could be knee-busting with such heavy loads. The first 2-3 days are the hardest. If you're in good shape, your body will likely adjust after that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe weather on the Lofoten is really unpredictable, so it makes little sense to look for a sunny week. That summer was insanely sunny and hot in all of Northern Europe, except for the Lofoten. :) And when I say summer, keep in mind you're in the Arctic circle - temperatures of 7-8C in a rain storm were not uncommon, especially with heavy winds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's mad beautiful on the Lofoten. Few people will only go once. I didn't want to leave, in spite of being soaked for 2/3 of the time we had on the islands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe prepared to pay premium prices for food and supplies. We carried dehydrated food which lasted about a week and a half. The other week and a half cost upward of 300EUR to feed two very hungry adults on the trail (no restaurants, no alcohol).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn planning a multi-week trip, always give yourself time to rest here and there, and do keep in mind that even a 5-10% delay in hiking speed will amount to something significant toward the end of the journey. When the weather wasn't horrendous we hit our daily markers, but descending down a rocky hill in pouring rain with little visibility isn't the place to rush yourself or your partner(s).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only negative aspect of this trip was the tourist trace. The Lofoten have become a very hot destination and unfortunately, a lot of hikers aren't really respectful to the nature (mostly around tracks easily accessible by car/bus). Besides, the trails on some places were severely eroded and are likely to be inaccessible in a few years time.\n\nThe beaches were littered with plastic, which is a shock when you haven't seen a single person in 2 days and yet you find brand new toys, in their package, scattered along the sand. But that's a sad reality in many, many places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could write a travel blog, I guess... LOL. But probably shouldn't. Ask questions below if you're interested in details on the planning, preparation or the trip itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, yeah - the photos don't do justice to the locations. ;)"

      "Well I typed a lot and it won't let me post so I will break it up into sections with multiple posts.\n\nI have been doing this a long time, and good food makes the trip that much better and helps in recovery of lost nutrients and keeps the body fueled.\n\nWell, I have always been a fan of packitgourmet.com. The burritos, burger wraps, tortilla soup and the breakfasts such as the deluxe breakfast (more like a scrabbled western omelets) are great.\n\nIf I am not doing prepackaged, for breakfast, the pancake mix pouches that you just add water, I package of the freeze dried or dehydrated strawberries or peaches makes a great breakfast, and a pouch feeds 2 people.  I either put the syrup in a 1-2 oz Nalgene or poach some condiments from cracker barrel or the local convenience store in the squeeze packs.  Precooked bacon from grocery store, needs a little heating in the pan or crisping.  Sometimes I do an omelet, have an egg carrier, get the small no refrigeration cheese blocks like what come in Christmas gift boxes and I dehydrate peppers, onions, tomatoes and put in ziplock.  Add water a few hours before needed and a quick simmer before starting the eggs.  Hot coco or instant coffee finishes it off, just add hot water.  Sometimes I get the touch of cream dehydrated milk, put in Nalgene with cold creek water and shake, delish.  Sometimes hash browns in the little milk cartons at dollar tree or grocery store, add water and a little oil, from condiment pack or small Nalgene.\n\nLunch can be simple or elaborate.  Simple is a pouch of white meat chicken, single serving, add a relish pack and a mayo pack, instant chicken salad.  I take triscuit cracker to eat it with, They are hard to crush and will stay intact in the pack.  A more elaborate would be something that requires boiling, pasta, ramen or a rice dish.  My favorite is spaghetti.  Get the flavoring pack from the grocery store, add one can of tomato paste, water, and freeze dried ground meat if you wish from packit. Simmer.  Put over pasta.  I keep the packs of parmesean cheese from pizza orders to top the dish off.  If I want garlic bread to finish it off, a little olive oil pack and some garlic salt, pan heated.  I use english muffins, hold up well in pack.  The cheese I mentioned above can be used several ways, sliced on cracker, cutup and mixed with mayo, pimento cheese.  Fried Spam, and things like nuts, granola bars, and anything from those Christmas style gift boxes do not require refrigeration.  A bunch of quick things I have listed for lunch, but the spaghetti and any pasta or rice dish has some prep time.",

      "You probably don't need that big lantern or several pots. \n\nI take one *good* high-lumen flashlight, and some will say that's not necessary. I just hate hearing a noise, shining a weak flashlight out into the woods, seeing eyes looking back, but not being able to tell what it is. So I do like a good light. For area illumination I use the light on my cell phone or on a power bank, though.\n\nI take *one* large titanium cup. It's my pot, my coffee cup, and my bowl, all in one. I eat in courses if necessary, or sometimes I'll wash out a freeze dried food pouch and reuse it as a bowl, sometimes after cutting it shorter. (Like, say, I have Mountain House for dinner, I'll cut the pouch in half and use it for my oatmeal in the morning.)\n\nI'd take at least a small power bank for your phone, even if you think you have enough battery life for the trip. Sometimes phones do weird things and run down fast, and that's safety equipment. (Turn the phone off when you're not using it, too.). Are you going to be in an area with no cell service? If so, do you have a satellite communicator like an Inreach?\n\nTake a good look at that medical kit and make sure there's nothing in it unnecessary. I have a pretty robust kit (I do long solo trips) and it's not that big. Mine has a tourniquet, quick clot, ace bandages, pretty robust boo boo kit, bag balm (also a good firestarter) and a wide range of meds, and is half that size.",
      "Well, there is a ton of stuff I would ditch.  Lantern is the obvious eye catcher.  Sit pad AND stool?  Pot and kettle (pot looks super heavy btw, if only boiling water either will work and pick the lighter one).  Nalgene bottle should go, get a smart water bottle and refill.  Ugh.  Just remembering me carrying my heavy bottles when I was new\u2026.  Looks like you have two cups.  And the yeti one is going to be heavy.  Though single wall metal cups suck at keeping things warm.  Multi tool is overkill.  A small Swiss for $20 will do the job and then some.\n\nPersonally, I would get a kitchen or postage scale and weigh your stuff before setting out and try to get the sum of the weight around 20lbs.  Including the clothes you are not showing.  But not counting the food, water and fuel. But mileage varies.  If you are using those weights a ton it may not be a problem.  I\u2019m just tired of carrying 40lbs unless I have to.  And even when I was younger and in better shape (once a nationally ranked oarsman) I would get migraines when backpacking.  Not debilitating.  But not fun.  Lightening my pack got rid of that.  It puts pressure on points you are not accustom to.\n\nAs for stuff you are missing - \n- I like to carry some extra line.  I carry about 25\u2019 that gets shorter every time I hack a section off of it.  Accessory cord or guyline is best.\n-  food storage strategy.  You can use the above cord for a bear hang.  I take a dedicated line as my cord above is 1.75mm and that does not work great for a hang.  But perhaps I have a little Sam Gamgee in me, but imo line comes in handy and does not weigh much (and I\u2019m pretty weight conscious).\n- med kit and some repair stuff.  A little duct tape wrapped around something is fine (water bottle, poles, \u2026).  A few safety pins and I also carry a needle and some stout thread.\n\nNot sure how far you are going.  If it is more than a couple of days, bring some body lube for chaffing.  Just saying.  That shit sucks.  I use squirrel\u2019s nut butter.  Lots of people like body glide.  Clean up at night and lube before hitting the trail makes a huge difference for me.",
      "I should have prefaced with this hahaha\n\nI am going with 10 people and flying to Denver. I am not carrying my food because i cam carrying a 2 person tent.\n\nI am not brining all this stuff, def not bringing 2 pots lol i am bringing extra stuff for others. \n\nI have fire starter and matched, water filter, toilet wipes. \n\nI have a few questions:\n\nIs the medic pack too big? For 10 people for 4 days?\n\nI am debating getting boots but I have always worn vessi\u2019s and they have served me well. But the longest ive ever gone was 7 miles, is it a bad idea to hike in Vessi\u2019s for a prolonged trip?\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for toothbrush/ toothpaste\n\nWill one butane canister last 3-4 days? \n\nWhat is your opinion on tent outside of bag\n\nAlso i think i want a different group pad",
      "I like taking a pair of cheap flip flops.\n\nAlso, you're in bear country, not sure if they make you take a bear can, but I'd take rope and a mesh bag to hang your food up, pit you food in zip lock bags.  \n\nAlso, along those lines get some bear spray when you get there.  Saw a saul charge a hiker out there a few years back.  Had to wait on the trail for an hour before she let us go.  The hiker that got changed was impatient.",

I am taking my 9 year old daughter and this will be her first backpacking experience. She loves to hike and camp but has never backpacked. I have not been on an overnight trip in a very long time, almost a decade I think! I tend to overpack food and am trying to keep this comfortable but efficient. \nWe will need dinner on the first night, a full days food the next, and breakfast and lunch the final day. \nThis is meant to be easy on her so we are only hiking in about 4 miles (Stafford  Beach) and setting up camp for the two nights and will venture out from there for the day. \nHopefully the image is big enough to read. \nI will also have instant coffee for me. The food shown is for one person minutes the extra meal, I will carry that. \nThe 9 year old is a decent eater, probably will not quite finish an entire dehydrated dinner but sharing one between us will not be enough.",

      "I never go without sour gummy worms anymore. Oddly specific but they\u2019re so great for a quick pick-me-up when fatigue sets in. Jerky too for some easy protein.\nI second all the others though - more food. Dedicated breakfast meal and probably 50-100% more snacks",
      "that is not enough food for any level of activity.",
      "More food if you can - my kids want constant snacks when walking or camping, partly from the exercise, partly boredom or motivation to get up the next hill. A couple of oranges, some trail mix with chocolate in it, and maybe a banana to go with breakfast each day would be my suggestion at least.",
      "Is this just the food for the 9yr old. That\u2019s probably still not enough",

      "I eat one of those dehydrated packs meant for 2 as 1 person. I am 130 pounds. you'll need more food",
      "Having done this multiple times with my boys (now 10 and 13) AND having done overnights as a Dne Leader and Cub Master  with Cub Scouts, I would HIGHLY recommend adding more snacks: Granola Bars, chocolates, more Belvita cookies, more cliff bars. \n\nAnd add Hot cocoa to each breakfast and Dinner - even in GA, I'm sure those mornings are chilly before you really get up and get going.\n\nAnd unless she eats  lot of dried fruit and nuts at home, don't make this the only snack you bring for your first backing trip....I made this mistake on my first trip with my oldest when he was young and he just went hungry for 2 full days because he refused to eat the \"healthy\" snacks I had brought.\n\nAnd where are the S'Mores???\n\nDon't make this trip focused on weight and ultralight backpacking. There is time to ease into that. Put more 'fun' snacks in your pack since it'll go and you'll shed those pack pounds over the two days.\n\nMy oldest is a picky eater and on our first trip - 2 full days, 3 nights - I packed over 50% of my pack with food and cook set because I knew I'd have a hard time getting him to eat. I had all the meals you list above: Oatmeal, PB on flatbread/tortilla, dried fruit and nuts, etc. But I also brough pancake mix, gnocchi and a quick 'sauce', and some other things I KNEW he'd eat because he eays them at home. I tried the 'camping' meals first, and when he utterly refused by the second day knowing he needed the calories/energy, I gave in and made pancakes for breakfast, and gnocchi for dinner. He loved it and we had a good time (if you discount him leaving his walking stick and talking me into hiking back 2 miles to retrieve it so adding an uneccessary 4 miles to the day's hike...).\n\nWe've had a lot of fun back packing and canoeing multi-day trips since those first ones, and eating / meals have gotten a lot better and much closer to what adult backpacking meals look like...not 100% there yet, but closer :)\n\nHave fun!",
      "Throw in a couple pudding/powder milk blends for dinner too? \nMy kid wanted to stop and snack every ten minutes. Food was the only motivator to move.",

Wild horses, castle ruins, beautiful beaches with cool sells... you can't go wrong.\n\nI've gone multiple times (day trips and overnight backpacking trips), and have always had amazing experiences. My first solo camping trip was at Cumberland! I'm so excited for you and your kid!",
      "I took my kids backpacking the other day and I brought food we like to eat at home too. Easy Mac, pop tarts, fruit, tons of snacks and flavor packets for the water.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be heavy, but bring fun stuff too, not just camp food.",
      "More food! Also empty out the day 1 and 2 meals into separate ziplocks. They will pack down smaller and take up less room. Write on the ziplock with a sharpie what the meal is, how much water, and how much time is required to cook them.",
      "Is there a way you can include more protein for satiety?  Also echo what other people have said more calories via fun foods like trail mix with M&Ms or some chocolate.",

      "I\u2019ve never taken kids backpacking, but I would take much more food per kid on camp outs when I was a Girl Scout leader.",
      "That looks like a little more than one day of food for my self while backpacking definitely need more if you got a kiddo with you. And probably a few snacks they really love",
      "The nice thing about food is, other than the wrapper which you should keep minimal anyway, you lose the. weight as you eat. So its generally not a terrible thing to take more than you might need",
      "It\u2019s a solid meal plan for trip number 2 or 3.. but the first one. Id pack her some extra food and snacks. She might get anxious out in the wild like that and extra food will help ensure she has a good time.  And even though it\u2019s not great for you out there. A sugary snack, candies, chocolate, etc. would probably help too. Just to make sure everyone has a good time.\n\nAnd when you get back and she sees there\u2019s a bunch of extra food and snacks. It\u2019s an opportunity to teach her how to trim down what you both pack based on what wasn\u2019t used. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
      "Like everyone else is saying extra snacks and 1-2 days extra food incase something happens. Also I would have her try everything you\u2019re bringing before hand if she hasn\u2019t had it before. Dyhedrated meals still gross me out it would suck to be 9 in the backcountry and hate the way the food tastes.",
      "Not enough food.",
      "I'd bring a lot more food that doesn't need any preparation. Cereal in baggies (e.g. Cheerios) sits easy in the stomach. Also some fun size candy bars, and some savory crackers like goldfish. Individual packets of Justin's peanut butter and chocolate hazelnut spread. Graham crackers. Nature bars or Fig Newtons. I know you probably don't want too much junk food, but it sucks being in the middle of the woods with no food that you want to eat. Hold back a couple extra candy bars for the hike back.",
      "I'm with everyone else, more food. Double the oats to start, extra snacks, and one full dinner backup. Plan enough that no matter what you bring something home. \n\nI have some experience in GA too! I can recommend a few spots pm me :)",
      "I can echo the comments that Cumberland Island is amazing. Don\u2019t miss out on Dungeness (the castle ruins) though it will add a couple miles if you tack that on to the hike up to Stafford. A cool day hike from Stafford is Plum Orchard. The Park Service give yourself of this turn of the century mansion - check with the NPS after you get off the ferry for times. \n\nThe Live Oak Forrest up to and around Stafford camp & beach is magical. \n\nOn the food discussion, I would echo the comments about more snacks. It may have been mentioned but GORP is good, though I use chocolate M & Ms with the salty peanuts instead of raisins\u2026but you can use raisins for a healthier option. \n\nMy wife & I also like Cheese Its &/or pretzels (we find ourselves craving salt on hikes). To keep them from turning into crumbs in the pack, we put them in empty Telenti containers (the gelato you can get at the grocery). \n\nIf the weather is cool enough, a block of cheddar cheese could be nice for first day meal component.\n\nFinal comment is on Stafford Camp itself. As of January this year, the water at Stafford camp is potable, so you can drink it without needing to filter or treat it. Anything north of Stafford you still have to filter, but it\u2019s nice if you are only going as far as Stafford. \n\nEnjoy the adventure and most of all the time with your little one. They grow up fast.",
      "To add to the people saying more; cliff bars, Luna bars, leathers, etc. are light, take up very little space and pack a lot of calories. 1 extra freeze dried meal and/or some bars can be your backup food. When we\u2019ve got the space and weigh to spare we\u2019ll usually bring a couple apples, oranges or kiwis. Fresh fruit can really hit the spot when you\u2019re backpacking and eating fence calories for a few days.",
      "Check out backcountryfoodie, small fee and you can stop thinking about your meals.",
      "My rule of thumb for a light backpacking trip is to take the number of calories I normally have per day and double it, making sure to have extra protein and fat in my macro balance. As an adult, that means about 4000 calories per day\u2026 too much is MUCH better than not enough! If I\u2019m going on a strenuous trek, I\u2019ll consume as much as 5-6,000 calories in a day, and I\u2019m a slender woman, at about 115 sopping wet. \n\nPlus, always about an extra day\u2019s food, in case of an emergency. \n\nFor the kids I backpack with, about 3,500-4,000 calories ensures they have the fuel they need to keep going, and if they don\u2019t eat everything, that\u2019s fine. Since it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve gone, and it\u2019s you kiddo\u2019s first trip, I\u2019d suggest getting ready made backpacking meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and bring plenty of snacks (beef and cheese sticks, combos, peanut butter m&ms, kind bars, etc. are all hits with the kids).",
      "This doesn't seem like enough food at all.",
      "I suggest only one night in the woods to start.   You need more food for sure, and I would want to ease daughter into the backwoods life.",
      "You will be hauling most of the weight so maybe pick up more freeze dried backpacking meals.\n\ngreen hatch chili mac n cheese is awesome (backpackers pantry). can't get enough. Rice and mash potato based meals are good too. \n\nif using instant oatmeal for breakfast maybe add raisins and brown sugar at home so its all premixed. The added flavor makes a huge difference.\n\nI tend to bring dried bpack foods as meals and snack on bars and trail mix and dried fruit (mango). Just me though.\n\nHave fun!"

The tent is new XMid 2. I could save 17oz spending an extra $350 for the pro. I could save 2.2 lbs emptying one smart bottle and filling it when we get to the campsite. \n\nMy kid is over the Trail Magik weight limit. He walked 60% of our first 1.3 mile neighborhood walk. He\u2019s capable of 2-3 miles but he\u2019s a 10 yr old medical/special needs non-verbal autistic kid and sometimes he\u2019s just done. He did walk 1 mile on his own last night.  He\u2019s also very slow over non-smooth surfaces. My hope is that he walks on his own and I only have to carry him if he is hurt or really tired.\n\nHis food is heavy because it\u2019s ready to feed meals that are 9.8 oz each (5 per day) that I feed through his G-tube. I tried a brand that comes in a freeze dried powder, but he\u2019s very sensitive to food changes and it did not agree with him. I tried it twice. The results were bad.\n\nHe could only carry a small fanny pack. He only started walking when three years ago when he was seven and he\u2019s not stable enough.\n\nAfter a test in the backyard, the first trip we want to do is a one night overnight to Skymeadows State Park in Virginia, which has a 1 mile hike-in and tent sites, bear box, chemical toilet, and a well.

      "Does your kiddos food need the stove? If not, you could go no-cook for yourself.\n\nPlanning water stops can definitely cut carry weight. Depending on where you are, it can add risk of water availability and water borne illness.\n\nThere are sometimes backcountry shelters/cabins that would give similar vibes, and could cut weight a bit. Possibly tent, sleeping pads, and cool gear depending on the cabin.\n\nWay to go!",
      "Not a first choice suggestion, but larger dogs can safely carry about 15% of their bodyweight. So, a 70 lb dog could carry about 10 lbs. Dog food is pretty light, and ideally you're filtering water for them along the way to reduce carry weight.",
      "It\u2019s already pretty dialed. A ULA pack might shave some weight. But it wouldn\u2019t provide the robust suspension that Osprey is known for. Does his food come in bulky packaging? Could maybe put it into lighter containers. \n\nOtherwise the only way to shave down from this would be to make it *feel* lighter. So, doing squats to get the leg and core strength up is an idea. Also doing practice walks/hikes with heavy weights on the legs would also bolster your strength and your control over the weight.\n\nHappy to see you taking him out there, should be a great trip.",
      "Ok so I hiked the PCT and the CDT both of which are very long trails. Weight mattered quite a bit and I learned a lot about how to loose weight. Keep it simple, only one set of clothes, 2 pairs of socks, undies are optional, take the brain off your backpack that weighs 1/2 pound. Cut any excess straps off your bag, look at the weight of your sleeping bag and tent. Cat food can stove or caldera cone are light options for cooking or consider going no cook. Simple and minimal dish set. Don\u2019t bring soap, toothpase, or any toiletries you can do without, don\u2019t bring a full bottle of sunscreen or bug spray, just what you need. A visible bottle of bleach is the lightest way to treat water (1 drop per Litre). The travel packs of antibacterial wipes are great. Clothing is very heavy so only bring what you need, especially rain gear and outer wear. Cut up your maps and toss and sections you don\u2019t need. Look at your food in a calories per ounce kinda way, and don\u2019t bring more than you need. Same goes for water, plan your water sources and don\u2019t carry any more than you need, plastic bottles are best. Take breaks at water sources and camel up rather than carrying excess water. Ounces lead to pounds so every little bit helps. Most importantly have fun and be safe!",

If you can lower bolth of your combined pack weight you may be able to swing what would be a normal back weight for bolth. Normal being 30 to 45 lbs. Without food and water.

If it\u2019s an option where you live and you have the skill set, it\u2019s a physically easier way to get into the backcountry, most of the time.",
      "One of our challenges I have discovered for going solo is managing him while I am otherwise occupied with some camp related task like setting up the tent or fixing his feeds. The autism/developmental delays make it hard for him to \"do nothing\" and He really has little grasp of the concept of me asking him to stay put.   \nI think I am going to consider the chair essential for him...It was useful in feeding him and keeping him in one place. Somehow I think tying him to a tree with some cordage would get CPS called on me. \n\nWe did set up at home and practice a bunch of tasks. Basically any time he needed something done - Feeding, diaper, etc, we went to our test camp and did it. Two things I noticed:  \n1. I was kneeling in the dirt a lot which was tough on the knees and the pants  \n2. I used the chair base for soft surfaces, but I feel like I need a small tarp? or some type of \"workspace\" for getting his feeding prepared. I have to open a pouch, add some water and some powdered oat milk and shake or stir it, then   suck it up in a syringe without getting the syringe covered in feeds and give it to him through a connector tube. It's messy. At home we use 2 syringes and a paper towel and a cup to measure . Here's what I'm thinking.   \n1. Use the syringe for measuring instead with the plunger removed.   \n2. shake the bag to mix or Use my spoon to mix and then eat the food off the spoon  \n3. feed with 1 syringe  \n4. pour water in syringe and shake to clean - I'll drink that to not waste it  \n5. fill the (mostly) clean syringe with water to flush the gtube  \n6 use 1 kleenex tissue to contain drips from the tube when I remove the syringe and wipe food off the syringe. \n\nI think the tissue is better than a reusable cloth that will be soaked with food and need to be cleaned."

Highland Way, you can easily do this. If you\u2019re doing the Wonderland Trail around Mount Rainier, it\u2019s considerably more difficult. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to eat dehydrated stuff out of pouches. Tortillas, peanut butter, hard cheese, dried meats, nuts, oatmeal, grits, tinned or pouches of fish\u2026anything shelf stable can be carried. \n\nIf your idea of what you want to eat is a poached chicken breast, a mixed green salad, and ice cream...you\u2019re going to have to be very creative.\n\nMost of those YouTube accounts are not showing you the logistics, because the logistics are not practical for backpacking. They\u2019re mainly cooking outdoors for aesthetics.",
      "I\u2019ve tried a ton of different brands and always go back to Backpackers Pantry.\n\nMy brother is always lobbying for fresh cooked meals, barbecue, etc when I take him on trips. It\u2019s completely unrealistic. You\u2019ll spend all of your time cooking and cleaning. I\u2019ll tell you what I told him : Backpacking is not about the food. You\u2019re going to be fine eating freeze dried meals.",
      "I've done a bunch of food options backpacking, but this is a hard question to answer without more on what your goals are.  I have a bunch of recipes that are instant rice with some quick protein (usually nuts) that are cheap, but I personally think packaged tastes better.  \n\nOn the other side I have a great salmon alfredo that uses foil packaged salmon and powdered alfredo sauce that tastes better than prepackaged (but still not great compared to home cooking) and is cheaper (especially if you have a group of 4+) but it uses a lot of water and cooking equipment and is heavier.  If I have a large enough group we would have carried two stoves anyway and water is easily accessible that starts to make sense, but by myself I pretty much never want two pots, let alone two stoves.   \n\nIf you're willing to buy (or already have) a dehydrator that opens other possibilities.  They're probably better for you long term and they can be cheaper (though you sometimes have things like powdered milk as an ingredient where if you're making 20 meals it's cheaper but if you're making 2 buying the smallest available size still offsets your savings) but I probably prefer packaged to most things I have dehydrated and you're talking a bunch of prep work so there's also a time cost.",
      "The longer I've backpacked, the less food matters.  Trail food sucks, it's that simple.   You're only going to be out there for like 5 days at a time, most people can't carry enough to go longer. But there's tricks to making it easier. \n\nTip for champions; Take restaurant sauce packs.  Hot sauce, mustard, mayo, soy sauce, anything.  It helps so much and you can get them for free everywhere. And, bake a chicken breast or two and put them in a ziplock bag.  Use as needed.  Same with bacon or steak.  Just cook it thoroughly so it lasts longer.  Or eat in in the first three nights. \n\nEvery morning for breakfast I eat oatmeal, dried fruit and peanut butter, and I always have coffee.\n\nFor lunches and snacks, I pretty much always carry carrots, mixed nuts, peanut butter, cheese, summer sausage, baby food squeezes (like applesauce, or broccoli carrots and peas, any of them really), fish packs, tortillas, and some candy. So I just find some kind of combination of those things til I'm not dying.\n\nDinner is the hardest, because you want something hot.  Here's some meals I make a lot; \n\nA ramen pack, a tuna pack, and some cheese. Bam.\n\nDehydrated rice, dehydrated beans, cheese, bacon bits, or chunks of precooked chicken, wrapped in a tortilla.  Bam.  \n\nCheese, summer sausage, tortilla.  Bam.\n\nPeanut Butter, dried fruit, tortilla.  Bam. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with leftovers on the trail as long as you have them in something that won't leak.  I've known guys that buy mcdoubles and egg mcmuffins and just take em.  It's food. I've taken burritos lots of times.  Who cares if it's hot? Would you rather have dehydrated pesto chicken? \n\nSome guys like carbs.  Bagels, a loaf of Italian bread, or rolls work great, and they're great for makeshift sandwiches.  You don't have to eat trailmix and beef jerky all the time. \n\nI eat lots of fish packets.  Tuna, Salmon, sardines, whatever. It's not about flavor. It's about super light, healthy proteins I don't have to prep.  \n\nHot drinks can take the bite out of cold dinners.  Teas, hot chocolates, ciders, anything. \n\nIt's about cooking.  Sometimes you have ramen, sometimes you have precooked rice and beans.  But what can you add?  You don't need precooked chicken, steak and bacon, but if you have one, and a packet of peanut sauce or curry sauce you can make ramen gourmet.\n\nAlso, ideally you and your trail buddy have different stuff, so you can share.  If he  precooked chicken, maybe you should bring some boiled eggs, bread and mayo so you can make chicken salad sandwiches? If he brings bagels, maybe you could bring mozzarella and pepperoni? (Which made me think, if you know you can have fires, that changes what you can cook.  Now you can make bagel pizzas.  You can't do that with a boiler.)   \n\nBut most importantly, don't think about food so much.  Just think about that first meal when you get back to town.  A big chicken fried steak with over easy eggs and a biscuit, covered in white gravy.  With a glass of orange juice and a coffee.  Or if you pull in late, a big enchilada with rice and beans, or a cheeseburger with fries and a couple beers.  Heaven. Makes 5 days of peanut butter and raisin tortillas worth it.",
      "Freeze dried food can make you super gassyyyyy...   \nBut, it depends on how much weight you're willing to carry! You can get like the precooked rice and lentil baggies where all you have to do it heat them up, but it's a little heavier because there's liquid in it.   \nYou can also pre-cook meals but again, heavier. Dehydrated meals will be the lightest to carry. There are a lot of cool cottage brands out there now - check out Garage Grown Gear, they specialize in small business and have some new brands on there that could be interesting to you!",
      "How long are your trips?\n\nA weekend - 4 days? No problem depending on what you like to eat.\n\nLonger than a week and you'll probably have to pack too much or fresh food will start to go bad.\n\nI pack a lot of oatmeal, pasta/gnocchi, flatbreads, peanut butter, cured meats/cheese, pancake mix, dried berries/fruit, bacon/sausage, eggs (but these last items I eat first couple days so they don't go bad/break). \n\nMy kids don't eat the typical backpacker food, so I've had to improvise over the years.\n\nAll of this is cooked on my single burner with a small cook pan/bowl or titanium cup."

      "I can recommend the sea to summit frontier pot it\u2019s with Teflon and works good but it\u2019s really expensive. In that I cooked everything like Bolognese, Chili con carne, meat with sauce and vegetables when I was backpacking in Patagonia and often cooked at campsites in town so food weight was no problem. While out trekking I kept the food more simple but still way better than most people. I used it combined with a normal aluminum pot from sea to summit in that I would cook the pasta or rice or whatever. One pot would pack into the other and inside that pot I would store my stove etc.\n\nYou need a stove that has a flame that\u2019s spreads out under the pot and not just heats the point in the middle for real cooking. I bought a no name one in Peru so can\u2019t recommend any but just go to the store with your pots and see which one could work.\n\nI had no problem carrying the extra weight (whole setup was around 800g without gas) for that I ate like a king compared to the people I met. Real food keeps you happy.\n\nMy friend had also a good setup it was cheaper he just had a big camping pot and a camping pan with one of those self standing stove that you clip to the gas can. You can imagine how we ate when we where out there combining our setups haha gnocchi steak vegetables today??\n\nAnother tip buy a normal Tupperware box you can use the top as a chopping board and you can store food or leftovers or whatever in it.",

      "I was concerned about the same thing. Just wanted to share that I found it much easier to cook on my MSR Pocket Rocket 2 by adding a diffuser on top of my stove. Specifically, I picked up one of the perforated stainless steel types. If you want to cook real food on the trail, a \\~6 oz diffuser can make the difference and provide even heating for any Ti pot you put on the stove. While adding a 'frivolous' 6 oz might be a grievous sin in over on r/ultralight, I couldn't find any single pan or pot that weighed less than my Ti pan plus diffuser AND was said to distribute heat well for cooking.\n\nThis is the one I got, for \\~$7 [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HM9ZSY](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HM9ZSY)  \nthe handle removes easily and won't be coming along on hikes, so the \\*total\\* weight of the product is a bit more. With handle removed it's 5.35 ounces according to my scale, so that brings my TOAKS\u00a0- D145mm plus diffuser to 8.1oz, and then my deeper cookpot and anything else can benefit from even heat distribution.\n\nWith a totally reasonable amount of clarified butter in the pan (1.5 tsp? maybe 2) making scrambled eggs with some shaved parmesan was almost as easy as with my good pans at home.   \n  \nJust keep in mind the mass of the thin Ti pan is WAY less than your usual frying pan at home. This means it takes way less total heat to go from \"not quite hot enough\" to \"burning your cooking oil\" so don't leave the pan over the flames and walk away from it. The diffuser will spread the heat hitting the pan so you get the whole cooking surface heating pretty evenly, but once the diffuser is warm it really doesn't slow down the heat coming into your pan."

I add extra carbs to things I normally wouldn't , for example I use a packet of hot chocolate as creamer in my coffee when normally I'd only use half and half but when hiking I need the extra sugar. I also just need more food in general when hiking because I'm expending so much energy. At home I eat one meal a day and maybe a snack, when backpacking it's three meals and several snacks. I don't bolus for food at all when I'm hiking, and I don't need to. His experience might be different, and it will take a little testing to find out what works.

Before I go to bed I simply measure out the water with the oatmeal and seal it. In the morning after I tear down camp I can eat on the go without wasting any time cooking.  \n\n\n(5) Assorted snacks - I keep these in my waistbelt pockets and just grab something if I feel like I need a boost. Pictured here is an energy gel, a meal replacement bar, cashews, and fruit leather.  \n\n\n(6) \"Cheese w/ sardines in mustard\" - What can I say... It's not ultralight, but if you can't have a little fun at camp then what's the point?  \n\n\nThoughts? What do you like to bring with you on a thru-hike?\n\nUPDATE: I'm back! It ended up being closer to 29.16 miles. I didn't attempt to eat the ramen bomb and didn't eat the cheese/sardines as I decided to enjoy them at home. The Thai Curry was only 8/10 bc I forgot to crush the noodles up and used too much water, but the real star of the show is the cold-soaked oatmeal with powdered coconut milk, powdered peanut butter, craisins, and walnuts. It hit just right on Sunday morning and with the gel and cashews, kept me fueled all day. I will admit I also had two beers and a small Gatorade someone else brought.\n\n[Here's my Strava recording](https://imgur.com/a/WRdC8es)",
      "The cheese gave me a flashback to a time when I was on a long hike and we ran out of food and water. We'd been hiking for two days without food and a day without water in 90\u00b0F weather. We went 2 miles off course only to find a dry spring and then have to hike back up the hill to main trail. During that break I looked in my partners bag and found a 1lb block of cheddar cheese. I asked why we didn't eat it before and was told that he forgot he had it. The cheese was separating and you could see cheese oil, much like the grease on top of pizza. After about 8 more miles off hiking we finally came to a questionable water source and just drank the water unfiltered and ate the block of bad cheese. \n\nTo keep it mild... The next morning was filled with monstrous cheese curd expulsions that came faster then you could pull down your pants. \n\nI'll never take cheese hiking again.",
      "Sometimes for day one i will bring a more fresh food that does not spoil easy. Hard boiled eggs, summer sausage and cracker or even an avocado to  eat with rice and chicken backpacking food.",
      "Vegan food. Go vegan.",
      "Looks pretty good. I like planning meals because it\u2019s one of the easiest and, for me, most fun things that you can experiment with. It\u2019s also one of the most rewarding, at least when you get it right and you try something new and delicious.  It\u2019s fun to go in a store or shop online for snacks. I\u2019m picky about calories per ounce so it makes it a more of a hunt. But when you find something new that you like - awesomely rewarding. \n\nBasically my food is similar.  I either do granola, if I want a cold breakfast. Or I do some sort of freezer bag porridge if I want a hot breakfast.  I always have coffee. I aim for around 800-1000 calories. Then I plan the rest of my day around snacks every couple of hours that I can have with short breaks. And I mix it so it don\u2019t too much of any one thing: bars, chips, cookies, nut butters, nuts - my only requisite is 150+ calories per ounce. And dinner is something hot. It\u2019s usually Peak Refuel (my favorite freeze dried brand so far) or I try to make a freezer bag meal. I again aim for around 1000 calories here."

      "Hope you have a great trip. \n\n\n * Extra batteries aren't necessary for a 3 day trip. If you are worried your current batteries in things are low, then swap them out before you start. \n\n\n * Unless you plan on returning it, root around in your first aid kit before you go so that you are familiar with the contents and labels. There are probably a few things you'd like to add/subtract. \n\n\n * Regardless of what you plan to make on your stove, those pans are impressively shitty to cook with. I bring it up because a good meal can make everything better, and a bad meal just makes the idea of being in the woods seem pretty regrettable. The crappy  metal is too thin to really spread out heat, so it chars food in spots and leaves other areas completely uncooked. For heating water, plan to lose at least half the water over the sides, because the damn thing is shallow and the wingnut works it self loose with the heating and cooling. Oh, yeah, those sporks will snap without warning if you try to get a scoop of peanut butter from the jar. \n\n\n * Everyone here seems obsessed with lint and fire starters. The little bottle of hand sanitizer most people carry to feel like they have clean hands are an alcohol gel. Get some tooth pick sized sticks, put a glob on them, and you're good to go. If you can't get a fire going from that, lint or fire starters aren't improving your chances. \n\n\n * Camp shoes, like sanuuks, crocs, even racing flats, are nice to let your feet and boots dry out. \n\n\n * Travel clothes. Keep a full change of clothes and shoes in the car, along with some wet wipes or a water jug and a towel. Even if it is just for the ride to a hotel, you maybe a bit too funky for confined spaces. \n\n\n * Rain gear. I go with a jacket, gaiters, and a pack cover. Some people just use a jacket and line their pack with a trash bag. Some go for the full rain jacket and pants and put a trash bag over the outside of their pack. Some people just have a poncho. Some just being an umbrella. Totally up to you, but having something for your person and gear is a very good idea. \n",
      "So much of this is personal preference. This is a good setup with a balanced approach on equipment and weight with some good ankle support to help with the weight. Many people add poles to similar setups. \n\nA next step would be clothes. One (maybe two if you want to stick with boots) pair of socks, one pair of pants, one shirt, and a down coat. I'd skip the overcoat unless its definitely needed. Its tempting to bring extra in case, though its better to learn how to deal with getting wet in a different way other than having extra of everything and practicing strong preventative care. \n\nThere are some pieces of gear you could cut without missing them by learning a few skills. The trowel, compass, extra spork, food cleaning brush, switch water for a Smart water bottle, think about moving to trail running shoes unless you have bad knees or ankles, smaller gas canister the nest time you pick one up.\n\nI'd think about adding chapstick and a small tube of sunscreen.

This will also provide complete proteins. You can combine these with spices to make various bean chilis.\n* Olive/Avocado/Grapeseed oil/ghee - this can add some essential fatty acids, as well as a large amount of calories for relatively little volume. It is extremely cost effective per calorie. You can easily add half an ounce to anything you are eating.\n* Shelf-stable dairy - this can add essential fatty acids, like parmesan or canned cheese.

Not exactly inexpensive, but there are versions that can be had for not too much.\n* Dehydrated potato/instant noodles, etc. - incredibly inexpensive source of carbohydrates, high volume (except potato powder/instant mashed) but low weight.\n* Shelf-stable meats - salami, summer sausage, etc. for ready-to-eat. cured pork jowls, etc., for when you have time to soak and cook.\n* Fresh fruits - bring a banana, tangerine, apple, etc., can freshen up a trail meal."

Just gotta be thoughtful when packing (I put any crushable foods carefully into the pack lid during the day). Another go-to trail lunch for me is tuna pouches, or tuna salad, on tortillas.

We're planning on doing 14ish mile days on mountainous terrain. \n\nHere's the breakdown of what I've got and the total calorie amounts if I know them: \n\nBreakfast: \n- 6 oatmeals (~200 calories each) \n- 6 TJ's instant coffee \n\nLunch: \n- 6 pita bread (only thing not pictured - 220 calories each) \n- Instant hummus \n\nDinner: \n- Home freeze dried lasagna, chili, and curry (safe to assume about 400 calories each)\n\nVarious Snacks: \n- 4 TJ's PB&C (310 calories each)\n- 4 snickers bars ( 250 calories each)\n- 14 protein bars (210 calories for the rxbars and 260 for the cliff)\n- Tillamook Jerky (840 calories total) \n- 3 Split PB and Jelly packets (170 each) \n- TJ's Mango Sticky Rice (420 calories total)\n- Mini Stroopwaffels (840 calories total)\n- PB Pretzels (1950 calories in total)\n\n- Salted Cashews (800 calories in total)\n- Salted Macademia Nuts \n- 3 Trail Mix packets (240 each) \n\n- Dried Mangos (360 calories in total)\n- Dried Coconut (680 calories in total)\n- Dried Pineapple\n- Dried Apricots \n- Dried Bananas \n\nOther: \n- 11 Liquid IV \n- Bag of magnesium supplements \n\nAny advice, comments, or reassurance? Should I add more food or should I add more salty items/carbs/whatever? Like I said, unless I have a preposterous amount of food, I don't mind carrying it. It weighs about 12.8 lbs (minus the weight of the pita bread, which I think is about 11 oz for 7). ",

      "7 days and 6 nights of food should weigh 12-14 lbs. Generally having food 3000 calories/day is the best you can do, even if it's a deficit. Variety is key! You have many options but lacking in variety: everything is quintessential healthy backpacking food. That gets old quick. Your dinners look solid, though. Edit: the dinners are slightly light on calories, add oil to them before cooking (see below).\n\nTo expand variety: consider bringing Swiss cheese (should last a week), beef jerky, pastries for the morning, Skittles, tortilla and sandwich meat (for the first 3 days), Pepperidge Farm cookies. Keep your bag out of the sun during breaks to keep food cool. And you can opt for vegetarian \"meats\" if that's your thing.\n\nTo add calories and flavor: consider bringing a small bottle of oil (1 oz in your dinner is an extra 250 calories), powdered whole milk (it's in the baby food isle and you add to oatmeal or dinner), textured vegetable protein (add to dinner), veggie soup mix (add to dinner)."

    "selftext": "TL;DR - Anyone using FoodSaver bags for cold soak meals? If so, can you share any tips/tricks?\n\nI\u2019m new to backpacking and am trying to be as minimalistic as possible with gear. Thus, I\u2019m looking at cold soaking my meals. We recently got a dehydrator for other kitchen projects, but I\u2019m hoping to use it to make meals for backpacking. In an effort to help preserve them and make them as compact as possible, I thought about using my FoodSaver to vacuum seal them in a bag.\n\nI saw several people post about using a FoodSaver to preserve and pack in meals, but they seemed to be heating them up or at least using hot water to prepare them.\n\nI also saw that some of you were using Ziploc freezer bags for cold soaking meals. While this is certainly similar, I didn\u2019t know if someone already tried this with FoodSaver bags and if y\u2019all had any tips.",

      "The issue you may have with a food saver bag is that you can't reseal it once you add the water. So depending on how long the cold soak takes this can be an issue. For instance if you want to cold soak your lunch or dinner starting the morning or at lunch how would you seal it so it can be in your pack? I myself use freezer ziplocs.",
      "You can use whatever you like as long as you can seal it and don't have to worry about water/food leaking out it doesn't't really matter what you use.  Heating just speeds up the time to rehydrate it's not necessary.  As for how long it takes it varies if it's dehydrated it shouldn't take that long, but if you are doing stuff like Ramen packs it can take quite a bit of time to rehydrate so it's essentially trial and error to know the exact time it will take.\n\nAnyway I hope this helps.  My advice is to try it before you commit, I personally hate cold soaking, it's not for me, so if I don't plan on bringing a stove I just bring dry stuff, but to each their own some people love it."
